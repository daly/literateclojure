{\Large{\bf Foreword}}
\vskip .25in

Rich Hickey invented Clojure. This is a fork of the 
project to experiment with literate programming as a development
and documentation technology.

Every effort is made to give credit for any and all contributions.

Clojure is a break with the past traditions of Lisp.  This literate
fork is a break with the past traditions of code development.  As such
it is intended as an experiment, not a replacement or competition with
the official version of Clojure.

Most programmers are still locked into the idea of making a program
out of a large pile of tiny files containing pieces of programs.
They do not realize that this organization was forced by the fact
that machines like the PDP 11 only had 8k of memory and a limit
of 4k buffers in the editor. Thus there was a lot of machinery built
up, such as overlay linkers, to try to reconstruct the whole program.

The time has come to move into a more rational means of creating and
maintaining programs. Knuth suggested we write programs like we write
literature, with the idea that we are trying to communicate the ideas
to other people. The fact that the machine can also run the programs
is a useful side-effect but not important.

Very few people have seen a literate program so this is intended 
as a complete working example, published in book form. The intent
is that you can sit and read this book like any other novel. At 
the end of it you will be familiar with the ideas and how those
ideas are actually expressed in the code.

If programmers can read it and understand it then they can maintain
and modify it. The ideas will have been communicated. The code will
be changed to match changes in the idea. We will all benefit.

I've tried to make it as simple as possible. 
Try it once, you might like it.

This is a literate program, inspired by Donald Knuth \cite{Knu84}. It is
intended to be read like a novel from cover to cover. The ideas are 
expressed clearly but they are grounded in the actual source code.

The code in this documment is the executable source. The appendix gives
the procedure for building a running system from the enclosed sources.

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Steps to build Clojure}
{\vbox {\vskip 0.1in}}

{\bf Step 1}

Basically you need the C program \refto{tangle.c} which you can clip
using a text editor and save it as tangle.c.

{\bf Step 2}

Compile tangle.c to create a function called tangle.
\begin{verbatim}
gcc -o tangle tangle.c
\end{verbatim}

{\bf Step 3}
Run tangle to extract the \refto{Makefile} from this document.
\begin{verbatim}
tangle clojure.pamphlet Makefile >Makefile
\end{verbatim}

{\bf Step 4}
\begin{verbatim}
make
\end{verbatim}

This will 
\begin{packeditemize}
\item create a new subdirectory called ``tpd'' containing
all of the source code
\item test Clojure
\item create a running copy of Clojure
\item create the pdf
\item start a Clojure REPL
\end{packeditemize}

{\vbox {\vskip 0.1in}}
{\bf {\large Steps to change Clojure}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Steps to change Clojure}
{\vbox {\vskip 0.1in}}

If you make changes to this document and want the new changes 
just type:
\begin{verbatim}
rm -rf tpd 
tangle clojure.pamphlet Makefile >Makefile 
make
\end{verbatim}
 
or you can combine them into one line:
\begin{verbatim}
rm -rf tpd && tangle clojure.pamphlet Makefile >Makefile && make
\end{verbatim}

This will destroy the old source, extract the Makefile, and rebuild
the system. On a fast processor this takes about a minute.

Resist the urge to edit the files in the tpd directory.
They are only there for the compiler. Edit this file directly.

You can change where Clojure is built. In the \refto{Makefile}
there is a line which defines the root of the directory build.
You can change this or override it on the command line to build
Clojure elsewhere.
\begin{verbatim}
WHERE=tpd
\end{verbatim}

To build a second copy of Clojure, or to work in some other directory,
just type
\begin{verbatim}
make WHERE=newplace
\end{verbatim}

Why bother with such a difficult method of programming? Because 
worthwhile programs should ``live''.

Programs ``live'' because people maintain them. Maintaining and
modifying code correctly requires that you understand why the program
is written as it is, what the key ideas that make the program work,
and why certain, not very obvious, pieces of code exist. Programmers
almost never write this information down anywhere. Great ideas are
invented, the code is written, a man page of documentation is created,
and the job is done.

Well, almost. What does is mean for a program to ``live''? How does a
program survive once the original developers leave the project? There
are many sources of information but almost no source of knowledge.
New programmers don't know what the ``elders'' know. In order to ``live''
and continue to grow there has to be a way to transmit this knowledge.

Literate programming is Knuth's proposed idea for moving from the
world of ideas to the world of information. This is not simply another
documentation format. This is meant to be {\bf Literature}. The ideas
are presented, the implications are explored, the tradeoffs are discussed,
and the code is ``motivated'', like characters in a novel.

You are encouraged to write or rewrite sections of this document to
improve the communication with the readers.

``But I have to learn latex!''. Well, for this document you do.
But \LaTeX is just more than a document markup language like
HTML and it is no harder to learn. It gives you the added advantage
that you have a real language for publishing real documents. Most
books are typeset with this technology and a lot of conferences
and Journals require it. If you can learn Clojure, you can learn
\LaTeX. If you're a programmer you will always need to continue
to learn, at least until you retire into management.

Having used literate programming for years I have collected some key
quotes that might stimulate your interest.

\quoteme{gray}{yellow}{4.6in}
{\vskip 0.1cm
I believe that the time is ripe for significantly better documentation
of programs, and that we can best achieve this by considering programs
to be works of literature. Hence, my title ``Literate Programming''. 
Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs.
Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to 
do, let us concentrate on explaining to human beings what we want a
computer to do.

{\bf --Donald Knuth ``Literate Programming (1984)''}}


\quoteme{gray}{yellow}{4.6in}
{\vskip 0.1cm
Step away from the machine. Literate programming has nothing to do with
tools or style. It has very little to do with programming. One of the
hard transitions to literate programming is ``literate thinking''.

{\bf --Timothy Daly in Lambda the Ultimate (2010)}}

\quoteme{gray}{yellow}{4.6in}
{\vskip 0.1cm
The effect of this simple shift of emphasis can be so profound as to 
change one's whole approach to programming. Under the literate programming
paradigm, the central activity of programming becomes that of conveying
meaning to other intelligent beings rather than merely convincing the
computer to behave in a particular way. It is the difference between
performing and exposing a magic trick.

{\bf --Ross Williams, FunnelWeb Tutorial Manual}}

\quoteme{gray}{yellow}{4.6in}
{\vskip 0.1cm
Another thing I've been enjoying lately is literate programming. Amazingly
it turns out to be faster to write a literate program than an ordinary
program because debugging takes almost no time.

{\bf --Bill Hart, SAGE Mailing list, May 3, 2010}}

\quoteme{gray}{yellow}{4.6in}
{\vskip 0.1cm
The conversation is much more direct if the Design Concept per se, rather
than derivative representatives or partial details, is the focus.

{\bf --Fred Brooks, ``The Design of Design''}}

\quoteme{gray}{yellow}{4.6in}
{\vskip 0.1cm
We are banning the old notion of literate programming that I used when
developing \TeX{}82 because documentation has proven to be too much of
a pain.

{\bf --Donald Knuth TUG 2010}}

\quoteme{gray}{yellow}{4.6in}
{\vskip 0.1cm
Once upon a time I took great care to ensure that \TeX{}82 would be truly
archival so that results obtainable today would produce the same output
50 years from now but that was manifestly foolish. Let's face it, who is
going to care one whit for what I do today after even 5 years have
elapsed, let alone 50. Life is too short to re-read anything anymore
in the internet age. Nothing over 30 months old is trustworthy or
interesting.

\chapter{From The Ground Up (Kyle Kingsbury)}

This is quoted from Kingbury. \cite{King13}
\section{Clojure from the ground up}

\subsection{Getting set up}

When you have a JDK, you’ll need Leiningen, the Clojure build tool. If
you’re on a Linux or OS X computer, these instructions should get you
going right away. If you’re on Windows, see the Leiningen page for an
installer. If you get stuck, you might want to start with a primer on
command line basics.

\begin{verbatim}
mkdir -p ~/bin 
cd ~/bin 
wget https://raw.github.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein 
chmod a+x lein
\end{verbatim}

Leiningen automatically handles installing Clojure, finding libraries
from the internet, and building and running your programs. We’ll
create a new Leiningen project to play around in:

\begin{verbatim}
cd 
lein new scratch
\end{verbatim}

This creates a new directory in your homedir, called scratch. If you
see command not found instead, it means the directory ~/bin isn’t
registered with your terminal as a place to search for programs. To
fix this, add the line

\begin{verbatim}
export PATH="$PATH":~/bin
\end{verbatim}

to the file .bash_profile in your home directory, then run 
\begin{verbatim}
source ~/.bash_profile. 
\end{verbatim}

Re-running 
\begin{verbatim}
lein new scratch 
\end{verbatim}
should work.

Let’s enter that directory, and start using Clojure itself:
\begin{verbatim}
cd scratch 
lein repl
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{The structure of programs}
\begin{verbatim}
boa$ lein repl 
\end{verbatim}
which responds with
\begin{verbatim}
nREPL server started on port 45413 
REPL-y 0.2.0 
Clojure 1.5.1
  Docs:    (doc function-name-here) 
           (find-doc "part-of-name-here")
  Source:  (source function-name-here) 
  Javadoc: (javadoc java-object-or-class-here) 
  Exit:    Control+D or (exit) or (quit) 
user=>
\end{verbatim}

This is an interactive Clojure environment called a REPL, for “Read,
Execute, Print Loop”. It’s going to read a program we enter, run that
program, and print the results. REPLs give you quick feedback, so
they’re a great way to explore a program interactively, run tests, and
prototype new ideas.

Let’s write a simple program. The simplest, in fact. Type “nil”, and hit enter.

\begin{verbatim}
user=> nil 
nil
\end{verbatim}

{\bf nil} is the most basic value in Clojure. It represents emptiness, 
nothing-doing, not-a-thing. The absence of information.

\begin{verbatim}
user=> true 
true 
user=> false 
false
\end{verbatim}

{\bf true} and {\bf false} are a pair of special values called
Booleans. They mean exactly what you think: whether a statement is
true or false. true, false, and nil form the three poles of the Lisp
logical system.

\begin{verbatim}
user=> 0 
0
\end{verbatim}

This is the number zero. Its numeric friends are 1, -47, 1.2e-4, 1/3,
and so on. We might also talk about strings, which are chunks of text
surrounded by double quotes:

\begin{verbatim}
user=> "hi there!" 
"hi there!"
\end{verbatim}

nil, true, 0, and "hi there!" are all different types of values; the
nouns of programming. Just as one could say “House.” in English, we
can write a program like "hello, world" and it evaluates to itself:
the string "hello world". But most sentences aren’t just about stating
the existence of a thing; they involve action. We need verbs.

\begin{verbatim}
user=> inc 
#<core$inc clojure.core$inc@6f7ef41c>
\end{verbatim}

This is a verb called inc–short for “increment”. Specifically, inc is
a symbol which points to a verb: \verb|#<core$inc clojure.core$inc@6f7ef41c>|
just like the word “run” is a name for the concept of running.

There’s a key distinction here–that a signifier, a reference, a label,
is not the same as the signified, the referent, the concept itself. If
you write the word “run” on paper, the ink means nothing by
itself. It’s just a symbol. But in the mind of a reader, that symbol
takes on meaning; the idea of running.

Unlike the number 0, or the string “hi”, symbols are references to
other values. when Clojure evaluates a symbol, it looks up that
symbol’s meaning. Look up inc, and you get
\verb|#<core$inc clojure.core$inc@6f7ef41c>|.

Can we refer to the symbol itself, without looking up its meaning?

\begin{verbatim}
user=> 'inc 
inc
\end{verbatim}

Yes. The single quote ' escapes an expression. It says “Rather than
evaluating this text, simply return the text itself, unchanged. Quote
a symbol, get a symbol. Quote a number, get a number. Quote anything,
and get it back exactly as it came in.

\begin{verbatim}
user=> '123 
123 
user=> '"foo" 
"foo" 
user=> '(1 2 3) 
(1 2 3)
\end{verbatim}

A new kind of value, surrounded by parentheses: the list. LISP
originally stood for LISt Processing, and lists are still at the core
of the language. This list contains three elements: the numbers 1, 2,
and 3. Lists can contain anything: numbers, strings, even other lists:

\begin{verbatim}
user=> '(nil "hi") 
(nil "hi")
\end{verbatim}

A list containing two elements: the number 1, and a second list. That
list contains two elements: the number 2, and another list. That list
contains two elements: 3, and an empty list.

\begin{verbatim}
user=> '(1 (2 (3 ()))) 
(1 (2 (3)))
\end{verbatim}

You could think of this structure as a tree–which is a provocative
idea, because languages are like trees too: sentences are comprised of
clauses, which can be nested, and each clause may have subjects
modified by adjectives, and verbs modified by adverbs, and so
on. "Lindsay, my best friend, took the dog which we found together at
the pound on fourth street, for a walk with her mother Michelle.”

\begin{verbatim}
Took 
  Lindsay 
    my best friend 
  the dog 
    which we found together 
      at the pound 
        on fourth street 
    for a walk 
      with her mother 
        Michelle
\end{verbatim}

But let’s try something simpler. Something we know how to talk
about. “Increment the number zero.” As a tree:

\begin{verbatim}
Increment 
  the number zero
\end{verbatim}

We have a symbol for incrementing, and we know how to write the number
zero. Let’s combine them in a list:

\begin{verbatim}
clj=> '(inc 0) 
(inc 0)
\end{verbatim}

A basic sentence. Remember, since it’s quoted, we’re talking about the
tree, the text, the expression, by itself. Absent interpretation. If
we remove the single-quote, Clojure will interpret the expression:

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (inc 0) 
1
\end{verbatim}

Incrementing zero yields one. And if we wanted to increment that value?
Increment increment the number zero

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (inc (inc 0)) 
2
\end{verbatim}

A sentence in Lisp is a list. It starts with a verb, and is followed
by zero or more objects for that verb to act on. Each part of the list
can itself be another list, in which case that nested list is
evaluated first, just like a nested clause in a sentence. When we type

\begin{verbatim}
(inc (inc 0))
\end{verbatim}

Clojure first looks up the meanings for the symbols in the code:

\begin{verbatim}
(#<core$inc clojure.core$inc@6f7ef41c>
  (#<core$inc clojure.core$inc@6f7ef41c>
    0))
\end{verbatim}

Then evaluates the innermost list {\bf (inc 0)}, which becomes the number 1:

\begin{verbatim}
(#<core$inc clojure.core$inc@6f7ef41c>
  1)
\end{verbatim}

Finally, it evaluates the outer list, incrementing the number 1:

\begin{verbatim}
2
\end{verbatim}

Every list starts with a verb. Parts of a list are evaluated from left to right. Innermost lists are evaluated before outer lists.

\begin{verbatim}
(+ 1 (- 5 2) (+ 3 4)) 
(+ 1 3       (+ 3 4)) 
(+ 1 3       7) 
11
\end{verbatim}

That’s it.

The entire grammar of Lisp: the structure for every expression in the
language. We transform expressions by substituting meanings for
symbols, and obtain some result. This is the core of the Lambda
Calculus, and it is the theoretical basis for almost all computer
languages. Ruby, Javascript, C, Haskell; all languages express the
text of their programs in different ways, but internally all construct
a tree of expressions. Lisp simply makes it explicit.

\subsection{Review}

We started by learning a few basic nouns: numbers like 5, strings like
"cat", and symbols like inc and +. We saw how quoting makes the
difference between an expression itself and the thing it evaluates
to. We discovered symbols as names for other values, just like how
words represent concepts in any other language. Finally, we combined
lists to make trees, and used those trees to represent a program.

With these basic elements of syntax in place, it’s time to expand our vocabulary with new verbs and nouns; learning to represent more complex values and transform them in different ways.

\section{Clojure from the ground up: basic types}

We’ve learned the basics of Clojure’s syntax and evaluation model. Now we’ll take a tour of the basic nouns in the language.

\subsection{Types}

We’ve seen a few different values already–for instance, nil, true,
false, 1, 2.34, and "meow". Clearly all these things are different
values, but some of them seem more alike than others.

For instance, 1 and 2 are very similar numbers; both can be added,
divided, multiplied, and subtracted. 2.34 is also a number, and acts
very much like 1 and 2, but it’s not quite the same. It’s got decimal
points. It’s not an integer. And clearly true is not very much like a
number. What is true plus one? Or false divided by 5.3? These
questions are poorly defined.

We say that a type is a group of values which work in the same
way. It’s a property that some values share, which allows us to
organize the world into sets of similar things. 1 + 1 and 1 + 2 use
the same addition, which adds together integers. Types also help us
verify that a program makes sense: that you can only add together
numbers, instead of adding numbers to porcupines.

Types can overlap and intersect each other. Cats are animals, and cats
are fuzzy too. You could say that a cat is a member (or sometimes
“instance”), of the fuzzy and animal types. But there are fuzzy things
like moss which aren’t animals, and animals like alligators that
aren’t fuzzy in the slightest.

Other types completely subsume one another. All tabbies are housecats,
and all housecats are felidae, and all felidae are animals. Everything
which is true of an animal is automatically true of a
housecat. Hierarchical types make it easier to write programs which
don’t need to know all the specifics of every value; and conversely,
to create new types in terms of others. But they can also get in the
way of the programmer, because not every useful classification (like
“fuzziness”) is purely hierarchical. Expressing overlapping types in a
hierarchy can be tricky.

Every language has a type system; a particular way of organizing nouns
into types, figuring out which verbs make sense on which types, and
relating types to one another. Some languages are strict, and others
more relaxed. Some emphasize hierarchy, and others a more ad-hoc view
of the world. We call Clojure’s type system strong in that operations
on improper types are simply not allowed: the program will explode if
asked to subtract a dandelion. We also say that Clojure’s types are
dynamic because they are enforced when the program is run, instead of
when the program is first read by the computer.

We’ll learn more about the formal relationships between types later,
but for now, keep this in the back of your head. It’ll start to hook
in to other concepts later.  

\subsection{Integers}

Let’s find the type of the number 3:

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (type 3) 
java.lang.Long
\end{verbatim}

So 3 is a java.lang.Long, or a “Long”, for short. Because Clojure is
built on top of Java, many of its types are plain old Java types.

Longs, internally, are represented as a group of sixty-four binary
digits (ones and zeroes), written down in a particular pattern called
signed two’s complement representation. You don’t need to worry about
the specifics–there are only two things to remember about
longs. First, longs use one bit to store the sign: whether the number
is positive or negative. Second, the other 63 bits store the size of
the number. That means the biggest number you can represent with a
long is 263 - 1 (the minus one is because of the number 0), and the
smallest long is -263.

How big is 263 - 1?

\begin{verbatim}
user=> Long/MAX_VALUE 
9223372036854775807
\end{verbatim}

That’s a reasonably big number. Most of the time, you won’t need
anything bigger, but… what if you did? What happens if you add one to
the biggest Long?

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (inc Long/MAX_VALUE) 
ArithmeticException integer overflow clojure.lang.Numbers.throwIntOverflow
 (Numbers.java:1388)
\end{verbatim}

An error occurs! This is Clojure telling us that something went
wrong. The type of error was an ArithmeticException, and its message
was “integer overflow”, meaning “this type of number can’t hold a
number that big”. The error came from a specific place in the source
code of the program: Numbers.java, on line 1388. That’s a part of the
Clojure source code. Later, we’ll learn more about how to unravel
error messages and find out what went wrong.

The important thing is that Clojure’s type system protected us from
doing something dangerous; instead of returning a corrupt value, it
aborted evaluation and returned an error.

If you do need to talk about really big numbers, you can use a BigInt:
an arbitrary-precision integer. Let’s convert the biggest Long into a
BigInt, then increment it:

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (inc (bigint Long/MAX_VALUE)) 9223372036854775808N
\end{verbatim}

Notice the N at the end? That’s how Clojure writes arbitrary-precision
integers.

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (type 5N) 
clojure.lang.BigInt
\end{verbatim}

There are also smaller numbers.

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (type (int 0)) 
java.lang.Integer 
user=> (type (short 0)) 
java.lang.Short 
user=> (type (byte 0)) 
java.lang.Byte
\end{verbatim}

Integers are half the size of Longs; they store values in 32
bits. Shorts are 16 bits, and Bytes are 8. That means their biggest
values are $2^{31-1}$, $2^{15-1}$, and $2^{7-1}$, respectively.

\begin{verbatim}
user=> Integer/MAX_VALUE 
2147483647 
user=> Short/MAX_VALUE 
32767 
user=> Byte/MAX_VALUE 
127
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Fractional numbers}

To represent numbers between integers, we often use floating-point
numbers, which can represent small numbers with fine precision, and
large numbers with coarse precision. Floats use 32 bits, and Doubles
use 64. Doubles are the default in Clojure.

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (type 1.23) 
java.lang.Double 
user=> (type (float 1.23)) 
java.lang.Float
\end{verbatim}

Floating point math is complicated, and we won’t get bogged down in
the details just yet. The important thing to know is floats and
doubles are approximations. There are limits to their correctness:

\begin{verbatim}
user=> 0.99999999999999999 
1.0
\end{verbatim}

To represent fractions exactly, we can use the ratio type:

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (type 1/3) 
clojure.lang.Ratio
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Mathematical operations}

The exact behavior of mathematical operations in Clojure depends on
their types. In general, though, Clojure aims to preserve
information. Adding two longs returns a long; adding a double and a
long returns a double.

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (+ 1 2) 
3 
user=> (+ 1 2.0) 
3.0
\end{verbatim}

3 and 3.0 are not the same number; one is a long, and the other a
double. But for most purposes, they’re equivalent, and Clojure will
tell you so:

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (= 3 3.0) 
false 
user=> (== 3 3.0) 
true
\end{verbatim}

{\bf =} asks whether all the things that follow are equal. Since
floats are approximations, {\bf =} considers them different from
integers. {\bf ==} also compares things, but a little more loosely: it
considers integers equivalent to their floating-point representations.

We can also subtract with {\bf -}, multiply with {\bf *}, 
and divide with {\bf /}.

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (- 3 1) 
2 
user=> (* 1.5 3) 
4.5 
user=> (/ 1 2) 
1/2
\end{verbatim}

Putting the verb first in each list allows us to add or multiply more
than one number in the same step:

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (+ 1 2 3) 
6 
user=> (* 2 3 1/5) 
6/5
\end{verbatim}

Subtraction with more than 2 numbers subtracts all later numbers from
the first. Division divides the first number by all the rest.

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (- 5 1 1 1) 
2 
user=> (/ 24 2 3) 
4
\end{verbatim}

By extension, we can define useful interpretations for numeric
operations with just a single number:

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (+ 2) 
2 
user=> (- 2) 
-2 
user=> (* 4) 
4 
user=> (/ 4) 
1/4
\end{verbatim}

We can also add or multiply a list of no numbers at all, obtaining the
additive and multiplicative identities, respectively. This might seem
odd, especially coming from other languages, but we’ll see later that
these generalizations make it easier to reason about higher-level
numeric operations.

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (+) 
0 
user=> (*) 
1
\end{verbatim}

Often, we want to ask which number is bigger, or if one number falls
between two others. {\bf $<=$} means “less than or equal to”, and asserts that
all following values are in order from smallest to biggest.

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (<= 1 2 3) 
true 
user=> (<= 1 3 2) 
false
\end{verbatim}

{\bf $<$} means “strictly less than”, and works just like {\bf $<=$}, except
that no two values may be equal.

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (<= 1 1 2) 
true 
user=> (< 1 1 2) 
false
\end{verbatim}

Their friends {\bf $>$} and {\bf $>=$} mean “greater than” and
“greater than or equal to”, respectively, and assert that numbers are
in descending order.

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (> 3 2 1) 
true 
user=> (> 1 2 3) 
false
\end{verbatim}

Also commonly used are inc and dec, which add and subtract one to a
number, respectively:

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (inc 5) 
6 
user=> (dec 5) 
4
\end{verbatim}

One final note: equality tests can take more than 2 numbers as well.

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (= 2 2 2) 
true 
user=> (= 2 2 3) 
false
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Strings}

We saw that strings are text, surrounded by double quotes, like
"foo". Strings in Clojure are, like Longs, Doubles, and company,
backed by a Java type:

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (type "cat") 
java.lang.String
\end{verbatim}

We can make almost anything into a string with str. Strings, symbols,
numbers, booleans; every value in Clojure has a string
representation. Note that nil’s string representation is ""; an empty
string.

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (str "cat") 
"cat" 
user=> (str 'cat) 
"cat" 
user=> (str 1) 
"1" 
user=> (str true) 
"true" 
user=> (str '(1 2 3)) 
"(1 2 3)" 
user=> (str nil) 
""
\end{verbatim}

str can also combine things together into a single string, which we
call “concatenation”.

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (str "meow " 3 " times") 
"meow 3 times"
\end{verbatim}

To look for patterns in text, we can use a regular expression, which
is a tiny language for describing particular arrangements of
text. re-find and re-matches look for occurrences of a regular
expression in a string. To find a cat:

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (re-find #"cat" "mystic cat mouse") 
"cat" 
user=> (re-find #"cat" "only dogs here") 
nil
\end{verbatim}

That \verb|#"..."| is Clojure’s way of writing a regular expression.

With re-matches, you can extract particular parts of a string which
match an expression. Here we find two strings, separated by a {\bf :}. The
parentheses mean that the regular expression should capture that part
of the match. We get back a list containing the part of the string
that matched the first parentheses, followed by the part that matched
the second parentheses.

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (rest (re-matches #"(.+):(.+)" "mouse:treat")) 
("mouse" "treat")
\end{verbatim}

Regular expressions are a powerful tool for searching and matching
text, especially when working with data files. Since regexes work the
same in most languages, you can use any guide online to learn
more. It’s not something you have to master right away; just learn
specific tricks as you find you need them.

\subsection{Booleans and logic}

Everything in Clojure has a sort of charge, a truth value, sometimes
called “truthiness”. true is positive and false is negative. nil is
negative, too.

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (boolean true) 
true 
user=> (boolean false) 
false 
user=> (boolean nil) 
false
\end{verbatim}

Every other value in Clojure is positive.

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (boolean 0) 
true 
user=> (boolean 1) 
true 
user=> (boolean "hi there") 
true 
user=> (boolean str) 
true
\end{verbatim}

If you’re coming from a C-inspired language, where 0 is considered
false, this might be a bit surprising. Likewise, in much of POSIX, 0
is considered success and nonzero values are failures. Lisp allows no
such confusion: the only negative values are false and nil.

We can reason about truth values using {\bf and}, {\bf or}, 
and {\bf not}. {\bf and} returns
the first negative value, or the last value if all are truthy.

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (and true false true) 
false 
user=> (and true true true) 
true 
user=> (and 1 2 3) 
3
\end{verbatim}

Similarly, {\bf or} returns the first positive value.

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (or false 2 3) 
2 
user=> (or false nil) 
nil
\end{verbatim}

And {\bf not} inverts the logical sense of a value:

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (not 2) 
false 
user=> (not nil) 
true
\end{verbatim}

We’ll learn more about Boolean logic when we start talking about
control flow; the way we alter evaluation of a program and express
ideas like “if I’m a cat, then meow incessantly”.

\subsection{Symbols}

We saw symbols in the previous chapter; they’re bare strings of
characters, like foo or +.

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (class 'str) 
clojure.lang.Symbol
\end{verbatim}

Every symbol actually has two names: one, a short name, is used to
refer to things locally. Another is the fully qualified name, which is
used to refer unambiguously to a symbol from anywhere. If I were a
symbol, my name would be “Kyle”, and my full name “Kyle Kingsbury.”

Symbol names are separated with a {\bf /}. For instance, the symbol
str actually comes from a family called clojure.core, which means that
its full name is clojure.core/str

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (= str clojure.core/str) 
true 
user=> (name 'clojure.core/str) 
"str"
\end{verbatim}

When we talked about the maximum size of an integer, that was a
fully-qualified symbol, too.

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (type 'Integer/MAX_VALUE) 
clojure.lang.Symbol
\end{verbatim}

The job of symbols is to refer to things, to point to other
values. When evaluating a program, symbols are looked up and replaced
by their corresponding values. That’s not the only use of symbols, but
it’s the most common.

\subsection{Keywords}

Closely related to symbols and strings are keywords, which begin with
a {\bf :}. Keywords are like strings in that they’re made up of text, but
are specifically intended for use as labels or identifiers. These
aren’t labels in the sense of symbols: keywords aren’t replaced by any
other value. They’re just names, by themselves.

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (type :cat) 
clojure.lang.Keyword 
user=> (str :cat) 
":cat" 
user=> (name :cat) 
"cat"
\end{verbatim}

As labels, keywords are most useful when paired with other values in a
collection, like a map. We’ll come back to keywords shortly.

\subsection{Lists}

A collection is a group of values. It’s a container which provides
some structure, some framework, for the things that it holds. We say
that a collection contains elements, or members. We saw one kind of
collection–a list–in the previous chapter.

\begin{verbatim}
user=> '(1 2 3) 
(1 2 3) 
user=> (type '(1 2 3)) 
clojure.lang.PersistentList
\end{verbatim}

Remember, we quote lists with a {\bf '} to prevent them from being
evaluated. You can also construct a list using list:

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (list 1 2 3) 
(1 2 3)
\end{verbatim}

Lists are comparable just like every other value:

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (= (list 1 2) (list 1 2)) 
true
\end{verbatim}

You can modify a list by conjoining an element onto it:

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (conj '(1 2 3) 4) 
(4 1 2 3)
\end{verbatim}

We added 4 to the list–but it appeared at the front. Why? Internally,
lists are stored as a chain of values: each link in the chain is a
tiny box which holds the value and a connection to the next link. This
data structure, called a linked list, offers immediate access to the
first element.

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (first (list 1 2 3)) 
1
\end{verbatim}

But getting to the second element requires an extra hop down the chain

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (second (list 1 2 3)) 
2
\end{verbatim}

and the third element a hop after that, and so on.

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (nth (list 1 2 3) 2) 
3
\end{verbatim}

{\bf nth} gets the element of an ordered collection at a particular
index. The first element is index 0, the second is index 1, and so on.

This means that lists are well-suited for small collections, or
collections which are read in linear order, but are slow when you want
to get arbitrary elements from later in the list. For fast access to
every element, we use a vector.

\subsection{Vectors}

Vectors are surrounded by square brackets, just like lists are
surrounded by parentheses. Because vectors aren’t evaluated like lists
are, there’s no need to quote them:

\begin{verbatim}
user=> [1 2 3] 
[1 2 3] 
user=> (type [1 2 3]) 
clojure.lang.PersistentVector
\end{verbatim}

You can also create vectors with vector, or change other structures
into vectors with vec:

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (vector 1 2 3) 
[1 2 3] 
user=> (vec (list 1 2 3)) 
[1 2 3]
\end{verbatim}

{\bf conj} on a vector adds to the end, not the start:

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (conj [1 2 3] 4) [1 2 3 4]
\end{verbatim}

Our friends {\bf first}, {\bf second}, and {\bf nth} work here too;
but unlike lists, nth is fast on vectors. That’s because internally,
vectors are represented as a very broad tree of elements, where each
part of the tree branches into 32 smaller trees. Even very large
vectors are only a few layers deep, which means getting to elements
only takes a few hops.

In addition to first, you’ll often want to get the remaining elements
in a collection. There are two ways to do this:

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (rest [1 2 3]) 
(2 3) 
user=> (next [1 2 3]) 
(2 3)
\end{verbatim}

{\bf rest} and {\bf next} both return “everything but the first element”. They differ only by what happens when there are no remaining elements:

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (rest [1]) 
() 
user=> (next [1]) 
nil
\end{verbatim}

{\bf rest} returns logical {\bf true}, {\bf next} returns logical {\bf
false}. Each has their uses, but in almost every case they’re
equivalent–I interchange them freely.

We can get the final element of any collection with last:

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (last [1 2 3]) 
3
\end{verbatim}

And figure out how big the vector is with count:

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (count [1 2 3]) 
3
\end{verbatim}

Because vectors are intended for looking up elements by index, we can also use them directly as verbs:

\begin{verbatim}
user=> ([:a :b :c] 1) 
:b
\end{verbatim}

So we took the vector containing three keywords, and asked “What’s the
element at index 1?” Index 1 is the second element, so this evaluates
to :b.

Finally, note that vectors and lists containing the same elements are
considered equal in Clojure:

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (= '(1 2 3) [1 2 3]) 
true
\end{verbatim}

In almost all contexts, you can consider vectors, lists, and other
sequences as interchangeable. They only differ in their performance
characteristics, and in a few data-structure-specific operations.

\subsection{Sets}

Sometimes you want an unordered collection of values; especially when
you plan to ask questions like “does the collection have the number 3
in it?” Clojure, like most languages, calls these collections sets.

\begin{verbatim}
user=> #{:a :b :c} 
#{:a :c :b}
\end{verbatim}

Sets are surrounded by \verb|#{...}|. Notice that though we gave the
elements :a, :b, and :c, they came out in a different order. In
general, the order of sets can shift at any time. If you want a
particular order, you can ask for it as a list or vector:

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (vec #{:a :b :c}) 
[:a :c :b]
\end{verbatim}

Or ask for the elements in sorted order:

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (sort #{:a :b :c}) 
(:a :b :c)
\end{verbatim}

conj on a set adds an element:

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (conj #{:a :b :c} :d) 
#{:a :c :b :d} 
user=> (conj #{:a :b :c} :a) 
#{:a :c :b}
\end{verbatim}

Sets never contain an element more than once, so conjing an element
which is already present does nothing. Conversely, one removes
elements with disj:

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (disj #{"hornet" "hummingbird"} "hummingbird") 
#{"hornet"}
\end{verbatim}

The most common operation with a set is to check whether something is
inside it. For this we use contains?.

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (contains? #{1 2 3} 3) 
true 
user=> (contains? #{1 2 3} 5) 
false
\end{verbatim}

Like vectors, you can use the set itself as a verb. Unlike contains?,
this expression returns the element itself (if it was present), or nil.

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (#{1 2 3} 3) 
3 
user=> (#{1 2 3} 4) 
nil
\end{verbatim}

You can make a set out of any other collection with set.

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (set [:a :b :c]) 
#{:a :c :b}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Maps}

The last collection on our tour is the map: a data structure which
associates keys with values. In a dictionary, the keys are words and
the definitions are the values. In a library, keys are call signs, and
the books are values. Maps are indexes for looking things up, and for
representing different pieces of named information together.

\begin{verbatim}
user=> {:name "spook" :weight 2 :color "black"} 
{:weight 2, :name "spook", :color "black"}
\end{verbatim}

Maps are surrounded by braces \verb|{...}|, filled by alternating keys
and values. In this map, the three keys are :name, :color, and
:weight, and their values are "spook", "black", and 2,
respectively. We can look up the corresponding value for a key with
{\bf get}:

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (get {"cat" "meow" "dog" "woof"} "cat") 
"meow" 
user=> (get {:a 1 :b 2} :c) 
nil
\end{verbatim}

{\bf get} can also take a default value to return instead of nil, if the key
doesn’t exist in that map.

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (get {:glinda :good} :wicked :not-here) 
:not-here
\end{verbatim}

Since lookups are so important for maps, we can use a map as a verb directly:

\begin{verbatim}
user=> ({"amlodipine" 12 "ibuprofin" 50} "ibuprofin") 
50
\end{verbatim}

And conversely, keywords can also be used as verbs, which look
themselves up in maps:

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (:raccoon {:weasel "queen" :raccoon "king"}) 
"king"
\end{verbatim}

You can add a value for a given key to a map with {\bf assoc}.

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (assoc {:bolts 1088} :camshafts 3) 
{:camshafts 3 :bolts 1088} 
user=> (assoc {:camshafts 3} :camshafts 2) 
{:camshafts 2}
\end{verbatim}

{\bf assoc} adds keys if they aren’t present, and replaces values if they’re
already there. If you associate a value onto nil, it creates a new map.

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (assoc nil 5 2) 
{5 2}
\end{verbatim}

You can combine maps together using {\bf merge}, which yields a map
containing all the elements of all given maps, preferring the values
from later ones.

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (merge {:a 1 :b 2} {:b 3 :c 4}) 
{:c 4, :a 1, :b 3}
\end{verbatim}

Finally, to remove a value, use dissoc.

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (dissoc {:potatoes 5 :mushrooms 2} :mushrooms) 
{:potatoes 5}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Putting it all together}

All these collections and types can be combined freely. As software
engineers, we model the world by creating a particular representation
of the problem in the program. Having a rich set of values at our
disposal allows us to talk about complex problems. We might describe a
person:

\begin{verbatim}
{:name "Amelia Earhart"
 :birth 1897
 :death 1939
 :awards {"US" #{"Distinguished Flying Cross" 
                 "National Women's Hall of Fame"}
          "World" #{"Altitude record for Autogyro" 
                    "First to cross Atlantic twice"}}}
\end{verbatim}

Or a recipe:

\begin{verbatim}
{:title "Chocolate chip cookies"
 :ingredients {"flour" [(+ 2 1/4) :cup]
               "baking soda" [1 :teaspoon]

In Clojure, we compose data structures to form more complex values; to
talk about bigger ideas. We use operations like {\bf first}, {\bf nth},
{\bf get}, and {\bf contains?} to extract specific information
from these structures, and modify them using {\bf conj}, {\bf disj},
{\bf assoc}, {\bf dissoc}, and so on.

We started this chapter with a discussion of types: groups of similar
objects which obey the same rules. We learned that bigints, longs,
ints, shorts, and bytes are all integers, that doubles and floats are
approximations to decimal numbers, and that ratios represent fractions
exactly. We learned the differences between strings for text, symbols
as references, and keywords as short labels. Finally, we learned how
to compose, alter, and inspect collections of elements. Armed with the
basic nouns of Clojure, we’re ready to write a broad array of
programs.

I’d like to conclude this tour with one last type of value. We’ve
inspected dozens of types so far–but what what happens when you turn
the camera on itself?

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (type type) 
clojure.core$type
\end{verbatim}

What is this type thing, exactly? What are these verbs we’ve been
learning, and where do they come from? This is the central question of
chapter three: functions.

\defsection{Understanding Persistent Vectors (Jean Lorange)}

This is quoted from L\'orange \cite{L13}.

You may or may not heard about Clojure's persistent vectors. It is a
data structure invented by Rich Hickey (influenced by Phil Bagwell's
paper on Ideal Hash Trees) for Clojure, which gives practically O(1)
runtime for insert, update, lookups and subvec. As they are
persistent, every modification creates a new vector instead of
changing the old one.

So, how do they work? I'll try to explain them through a series of
blogposts, in which we look at manageable parts each time. It will be
a detailed explanation, with all the different oddities around the
implementation as well. Consequently, this blog series may not be the
perfect fit for people who want a "summary" on how persistent vectors
work.

For today, we'll have a look at a naive first attempt, and will cover
updates, insertion and popping (removal at the end).

Note that this blogpost does not represent how PersistentVector is
implemented: There are some speed optimizations, solutions for
transients and other details which we will cover later. However, this
serves as a basis for understanding how they work, and the general
idea behind the vector implementation.  

The Basic Idea

Mutable vectors and ArrayLists are generally just arrays which grows
and shrinks when needed. This works great when you want mutability,
but is a big problem when you want persistence. You get slow
modification operations because you'll have to copy the whole array
all the time, and it will use a lot of memory. It would be ideal to
somehow avoid redundancy as much as possible without losing
performance when looking up values, along with fast operations. That
is exactly what Clojure's persistent vector does, and it is done
through balanced, ordered trees.

The idea is to implement a structure which is similar to a binary
tree. The only difference is that the interior nodes in the tree have
a reference to at most two subnodes, and does not contain any elements
themselves. The leaf nodes contain at most two elements. The elements
are in order, which means that the first element is the first element
in the leftmost leaf, and the last element is the rightmost element in
the rightmost leaf. For now, we require that all leaf nodes are at the
same depth. As an example, take a look at the tree below: It has
the integers 0 to 8 in it, where 0 is the first element and 8 the
last. The number 9 is the vector size:

{\bf Visualization of a vector with 10 elements in it.}

But here's the issue: We cannot do that if we want to be
persistent. And this would obviously not work if we wanted to update
an element! We would need to copy the whole structure, or at least
parts of it.

To minimize copying while retaining full persistence, we perform path
copying: We copy all nodes on the path down to the value we're about
to update or insert, and replace the value with the new one when we're
at the bottom. A result of multiple insertions is shown below. Here,
the vector with 7 elements share structure with a vector with 10
elements:

{\bf A visualization of two vectors, which use structural sharing.}
\end{center}

The pink coloured nodes and edges are shared between the vectors,
whereas the brown and blue are separate. Other vectors not visualized
may also share nodes with these vectors.  Update

The easiest "modification" operator to understand would be
updates/replacing values in a vector, so we will explain how updating
works first. In Clojure, that's an assoc modification, or an
update-in.

To update an element, we would have to walk the tree down to the leaf
node where the element is place. While we walk down, we copy the nodes
on our path to ensure persistence. When we've gotten down to the leaf
node, we copy it and replace the value we wanted to replace with the
new value. We then return the new vector with the modified path.

As an example, let's assume we perform an assoc on the vector with the
elements from 0 to 8, like this:

\begin{verbatim}
(def brown [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8])
(def blue (assoc brown 5 'beef))
\end{verbatim}

The internal structures, where the blue one has the copied path, is
shown below:

{\bf Two vectors, where we've updated a value.}
\end{center}

Given that we have a way to know which node to go down, this seems
easy enough. We'll go through how we find the path to a specific index
in a later part of this series.  

\subsection{Insertion}

Insertion is not too much different from an update, except that we
have some edge cases where we have to generate nodes in order to fit
in a value. We essentially have three cases:

    There is room for a new value in the rightmost leaf node.
    There is space in the root, but not in the rightmost leaf node.
    There is not enough space in the current root.

We'll go through them all, as their solutions are not that difficult
to grasp.  

\subsubsection{Just Like Assoc}

Whenever there is enough space in the rightmost leaf node, we can just
do as we do when we perform an assoc: We just copy the path, and at
the newly created leaf node, we put in the value to the right of the
rightmost element.

As an example, here's how we would do (conj [0 1 2 3 4] 5), and the
internal structures from doing so. black is the old:

{\bf Insertion with enough space in the leaf node.}
\end{center}

That's it. There's no magic, just path copying and insertion in the leaf node.

\subsubsection{Generate Nodes When You Need Them}

So, what do we do when there's not enough space in the leftmost leaf
node? Luckily, we'll never end up in a position where we find out that
we're in the wrong leaf node: We will always take the right path down
to the leaf node.

Instead, we will realize that the node we're trying to go down to
doesn't yet exist (the pointer is null). When a node doesn't exist, we
generate one and set that one as the "copied" node.

{\bf Insertion where we generate new nodes instead of copying.}
\end{center}

In the figure above, the black nodes represent original nodes. 

\subsubsection{Root Overflow}

The last case is the root overflow case. This happens when there isn't
more space in the tree with the current root node.

It's not that difficult to understand how we would solve this: We make
a new root node, and set the old root as the first child of the new
root. From there on, we perform the node generating, just as we did in
the previous solution.

{\bf Insertion where we generate a new root.}
\end{center}

One thing is to solve the problem, but detecting when it happens is
also important. Luckily, this is also rather easy. When we have a
two-way branching vector, this happens when the old vector's size is a
power of two. Generally speaking, an n-way branching vector will have
an overflow when the size is a power of n.  

\subsection{Popping}

The solutions for popping (removing the last element) isn't that
difficult to grasp either. Popping similar to inserting in that there
are three cases:

    The rightmost leaf node contains more than one element.
    The rightmost leaf node contains exactly one element (zero after popping).
    The root node contains exactly one element after popping.

Essentially, these are all ways of reverting 1, 2 and 3 in the
previous section, neither of which are extremely complex.

\subsubsection{Dissoc to the Rescue}

Again, we have a case where we can just do as we do when we update a
structure: We copy the path down to the rightmost leaf node, and
remove the rightmost element in the copied leaf node. As long as there
is at least one element left in the new leaf node, we don't have to do
any magic.

Keep in mind that popping multiple times on a vector will not yield
identical vectors: They are equal, but they don't share the root. For
instance,

\begin{verbatim}
(def brown [0 1 2 3 4 5])
(def blue (pop brown))
(def green (pop brown))
\end{verbatim}

will result in the following internal structure.

\subsubsection{Removing Empty Nodes}

Whenever we have a leaf node with only a single node, we have a
different case. We would like to avoid empty nodes in our tree at all
cost. Therefore, whenever we have an empty node, instead of returning
it, we return null instead. The parent node will then contain a null
pointer, instead of a pointer to an empty node:

{\bf Popping and removing a leaf node.}
\end{center}

Here, the brown vector is the original, whereas the blue one is the
popped one.

Unfortunately, it is not as easy as to just remove leaf nodes. You
see, if we return a null pointer to a node, which originally only had
one child, we must convert that one into a null pointer which we send
back: The results of emptying a node propagates upwards. This is a bit
tricky to get right, but essentially it works by looking at the new
child, check if it is null and is supposed to be placed at index 0,
and return null if that's the case.

If this was implemented in Clojure, it may look something like this
recursive function:

\begin{verbatim}
(defn node-pop [idx depth cur-node]
  (let [sub-idx (calculate-subindex idx depth)]
    (if (leaf-node? depth)
      (if (== sub-idx 0)
        nil
        (copy-and-remove cur-node sub-idx))
      ; not leaf node
      (let [child (node-pop idx (- depth 1)
                            (child-at cur-node sub-idx))]
        (if (nil? child)
          (if (== sub-idx 0)
            nil
            (copy-and-remove cur-node sub-idx))
          (copy-and-replace cur-node sub-idx child))))))
\end{verbatim}

When such a function has been implemented, node removal has been taken
care of completely. As an example, see the graph below. Here, the
popped (blue) vector has removed two nodes: The leaf node containing c
and its parent.

{\bf Popping with bad root handling.}
\end{center}

That's right, we'd have a root with a single pointer to a child
node. Pretty useless, as we would always move down into the child when
we lookup or assoc values, and inserting values would create a new
root. What we would like to do is to get rid of it.

This is possibly the easiest thing in this blogpost to actually do:
After we have finished popping, check if the root node contains only a
single child (check that the second child is null, for instance). If
that's the case, and the root node is not a leaf node, we can just
replace the root node with its child.

The result is, as expected, a new vector (blue) with the first child
of the original vector's root node as root:

\subsection{O(1) != O(log n)}

Some people out there are probably wondering how this can be said to
be O(1) at all. In fact, with only two children per node, this is
O(log2 n), which is (relatively) far from O(1).

However, no one has said that we have to only have two children per
node (often referred to as the branching factor). Clojure has 32 per
node, which in result turns into very shallow trees. In fact, the
trees will be at most 6 nodes deep if you have less than 1 billion
elements in the vector. You need about 35 billion elements to get up
to a depth of 8 nodes. At that point, I would believe memory
consumption is a more serious issue.

To actually see the difference: Here is a 4-way branching tree with 14
elements, which only is 2 levels deep. If you scroll up a bit, you'll
see a figure with two vectors containing 13 and 12 elements,
respectively. With two-way branching, this is already 4 levels deep,
double the height as this one.

{\bf A 4-way branching vector.}
\end{center}

As a result of the incredibly shallow trees, we tend to call
modifications and lookup of Clojure vectors to be "effectively"
constant time, although they in theory are O(log32 n). People with
basic knowledge in big O notation know that this is exactly the same
as O(log n), but for marketing reasons people like to add in the
constant factor.

To understand how we pick the right branch, I think it's good to give
the proper name of the structure and explain why it is named that. It
sounds a bit weird to explain branching through the name of a data
structure, but it makes sense when you consider that such a name may
describe how it works.  Naming

A more formal name for Clojure's persistent vector structure is
persistent bit-partitioned vector trie. What I explained in the
previous post was how persistent digit-partitioned vector tries
work. Don't worry, a bit-partitioned one is just an optimized
digit-partitioned trie, and in the previous post there is nothing
different about them. In this one, there is a small difference related
to performance. It has otherwise no practical differences.

I guess many of you don't know all of those words I mentioned in the
above paragraph, so let's describe them, one by one.

\subsection{Persistence}

In the last post, I used the word persistent. I said we want to be
"persistent", but didn't really explain what persistence itself really
means.

A persistent data structure doesn't modify itself: Strictly speaking
they don't have to be immutable internally, just have to be perceived
as such. Whenever you do "updates", "inserts" and "removals" on a
persistent data structure, you get a new data structure back. The old
version will always be consistent, and whenever given some input in,
it will always spit out the same output.

When we talk about a fully persistent data structure, all versions of
a structure should be updateable, meaning that all possible operations
you can do on a version can be performed on another. In early
"functional data structure" time, it was common to "cheat" with the
structures and make the older versions "decay" over time by mutating
the internals, making them slower and slower compared to the newer
versions. However, Rich Hickey decided that all the versions of
Clojure's persistent structures should have the same performance
guarantees, regardless of which version of the structure you are
using.  

Vector

A vector is a one-dimensional growable array. C++'s std::vector and
Java's java.util.ArrayList are examples of mutable
implementations. There's not much more to it than that, really. A
vector trie is a trie which represents a vector. It doesn't have to be
persistent, but in our case, it is.

Trie

Tries are a specific type of trees, and I think it's best to show the
actual difference by explaining the more known trees first.

In RB-trees and most other binary trees, mappings or elements are
contained in the interior nodes. Picking the right branch is done by
comparing the element/key at the current node: If the element is lower
than the node element, we branch left, and if it is higher, we branch
right. Leaves are usually null pointers/nil, and doesn't contain
anything.

{\bf A RB-tree} 
\end{center}

The RB-tree above is taken from Wikipedia's article on RB-trees. I'm
not going to explain how those work in detail, but let us take a tiny
example on how we check if 22 is contained in the RB-tree:

\begin{verbatim}
    We start at the root, 13, and compare it with 22. 
    As 13 < 22, we go right.
    The new node has 17 in it, and compare it with 22. 
    As 17 < 22, we still go right.
    The next node we've walked into is 25. 
    As 25 > 22, we go left.
    The next node is 22, so we know that 22 is contained in the tree.
\end{verbatim}

If you want a good explanation on how RB-trees work, I would recommend
Julienne Walker's Red Black Tree Tutorial.

A trie, on the other hand, has all the values stored in its
leaves. Picking the right branch is done by using parts of the key
as a lookup. Consequently, a trie may have more than two branches. In
our case, we may have as many as 32!

{\bf A trie}
\end{center}

An example of a general trie is illustrated in the figure above. That
specific trie is a map: It takes a string of length two, and returns
an integer represented by that string if it exists in the trie. ac has
the value 7, whereas ba has the value 8. Here's how the trie works:

For strings, we split the string into characters. We then take the
first character, find the edge represented by this value, and walk
down that edge. If there is no edge for that value, we stop, as it is
not contained in the trie. If not, we continue with the second
character, and so on. Finally, when we are done, we return the value
if it exists.

As an example, consider ac. We do as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
    We split ac up into [a, c], and start at the root node.
    We check if there is an edge in the node for a, 
      and there is: We follow it.
    We check if there is an edge in the node for c, 
      and there is. We follow that as well.
    We have no more characters left, which means the current node contains 
      our value, 7. We therefore return 7.
\end{verbatim}

Clojure's Persistent Vector is a trie where the indices of elements
are used as keys. But, as you may guess, we must split up the index
integers in some way. To split up integers, we either use digit
partitioning or its faster sibling, bit partitioning.

Digit Partitioning

Digit partitioning means that we split up the key into digits, which
we then use as a basis for populating a trie. For instance, we can
split up the key 9128 to [9, 1, 2, 8], and put an element into a trie
based on that. We may have to pad with zeroes at the front of the
list, if the depth of the trie is larger than the size of the list.

We can also use whatever base we would like, not just base 10. We
would then have to convert the key to the base we wanted to use, and
use the digits from the conversion. As an example, consider 9128 yet
again. 9128 is 35420 in base 7, so we would have to use the list [3,
5, 4, 2, 0] for lookup/insertion in the trie.

{\bf Visualization of the 35420 lookup.}
\end{center}

The trie (laying sideways, without the edges and nodes we're not
walking) above shows how we traverse a digit-partitioned trie: We pick
the most significant digit, in this case 3, and walk that specific
branch. We continue with the second most significant digit in the same
manner, until we have no digits left. When we've walked the last
branch, the object we're standing with — the first object in the
rightmost array in this case — is the object we wanted to look up.

Implementing such a lookup scheme is not too hard, if you know how to
find the digits. Here's a Java version where everything not related to
lookup is stripped away:

\begin{verbatim}
public class DigitTrie {
  public static final int RADIX = 7;

  // Array of objects. Can itself contain an array of objects.
  Object[] root;
  // The maximal size/length of a child node (1 if leaf node)
  int rDepth; // equivalent to RADIX ** (depth - 1)

  public Object lookup(int key) {
    Object[] node = this.root;

    // perform branching on internal nodes here
    for (int size = this.rDepth; size > 1; size /= RADIX) {
      node = (Object[]) node[(key / size) % RADIX];
      // If node may not exist, check if it is null here
    }

    // Last element is the value we want to lookup, return it.
    return node[key % RADIX];
  }  
}
\end{verbatim}

The rDepth value represents the maximal size of a child of the root
node: A number with n digits will have n to the power of RADIX
possible values, and we must be able to put them all in the trie
without having collisions.

In the for loop within the lookup method, the value size represents
the maximal size a child of the current node can have. For each child
we go over, that size is decremented by the branching factor, i.e. the
radix or base of the digit trie.

The reason we're performing a modulo operation on the result is to
ignore the more significant digits — digits we've branched on
earlier. We could potentially remove the higher digit from the key
every time we branch into a child, but the code would be a tiny bit
more complicated in that case.  Bit Partitioning

Digit-partitioned tries would generally have to do a couple of integer
divisions and modulo operations. Doing this is on every branch we must
take is a bit time consuming. We would therefore like to speed this
part up if it is possible.

So, as you may guess, bit-partitioned tries are a subset of the
digit-partitioned tries. All digit-partitioned tries in a base which
is a power of two (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc) can be turned into
bit-partitioned ones. With some knowledge of bit manipulation, we can
remove those costly arithmetic operations.

Conceptually, it works in the same way as digit partitioning
does. However, instead of splitting the key into digits, we split it
into chunks of bits with some predefined size. For 32-way branching
tries, we need 5 bits in each part, and for 4-way branching tries, we
need 2. In general, we need as many bits as the size of our exponent.

So, why is this faster? By using bit tricks, we can get rid of both
integer division and modulo. If power is two to the power of n, we can
use that 
\begin{verbatim}
x / power == x >>> n and
x % power == x & (power - 1). 
\end{verbatim}

These formulas are just identities related to how integers are
represented internally, namely as sequences of bits.

If we use this result and combine it with the previous implementation,
we end up with the following code:

\begin{verbatim}
public class BitTrie {
  public static final int BITS = 5,
                          WIDTH = 1 << BITS, // 2^5 = 32
                          MASK = WIDTH - 1; // 31, or 0x1f

  // Array of objects. Can itself contain an array of objects.
  Object[] root;
  // BITS times (the depth of this trie minus one).
  int shift;

  public Object lookup(int key) {
    Object[] node = this.root;

    // perform branching on internal nodes here
    for (int level = this.shift; level > 0; level -= BITS) {
      node = (Object[]) node[(key >>> level) & MASK];
      // If node may not exist, check if it is null here
    }

    // Last element is the value we want to lookup, return it.
    return node[key & MASK];
  }  
}
\end{verbatim}

This is more or less exactly what Clojure's implementation is doing!
See these lines of the Clojure code to verify it; The only difference
is that it performs boundary checks and a tail check as well.

The important thing to note here is that we've not only changed the
operators, but we've also replaced the rDepth value with a shift
value. Instead of storing the whole value, we're only storing the
exponent. This makes us able to use bitshifting on the key, which we
use in the (key >>> level) part. The other parts should be fairly
straightforward to understand, given that one knows bit operations
well. However, let's take an example for the ones unfamiliar with such
tricks. The explanation is quite thorough, so feel to skip parts you
understand.

Say we have only have 2 bit partitioning (4-way branching) instead of
5 bits (32-way) for visualization purposes. If we want to look up a
value in a trie with 887 elements, we would have a shift equal to 8:
All the children of the root node can contain at most 1 << 8 == 256
elements each. The width and mask is also changed by the bit count:
The mask will here be 3 instead of 31.

{\bf Visualization of the 626 lookup.}
\end{center}

Say we want to look up the contents of the element with key 626. 626
in its binary representation is 0000 0010 0111 0010. Following the
algorithm, step by step, both written above and within Clojure's
source code, we would have to do the following:

\begin{verbatim}
    node is set up to be the root note, and level is set up to be 8.
    As level is over 0, we start the for loop.
        We perform the operation key >>> level first. In this case, 
          this is 636 >>> 8, which cuts away the first 8 bits: We're left 
          with 0000 0010 or 2 in decimal.
        We perform the masking: (key >>> level) & MASK == 2 & 3. The 
          masking sets all the bits except the first two to zero. This 
          yields no difference here: We still have 2.
        We replace the current node with its child at index 2.
    We decrement level by 2, and set it to 6.
    As level is over 0, we continue the for loop.
        We again perform the operation key >>> level == 636 >>> 6. This 
          cuts away the last 6 bits, and we're left with 0000 0010 01, 
          or 9 in decimal.
        We perform the masking: (key >>> level) & MASK == 9 & 3, 
          or 1001 & 0011 in binary. This shaves off the top 10, 
          and we're left with 01, or 1 in decimal.
        We replace the current node with its child at index 1.
    We decrement level by 2, and set it to 4.
    As level is over 0, we continue the for loop
        Same trick here again. 636 >>> 4 leaves us with the bits 0010 0111.
        The mask sets all but the 2 first bits to zero, and we're left with 11.
        We replace the current node with its child at index 0b11 == 3.
    We decrement level by 2, and set it to 2.
    As level is over 0, we continue the for loop
        636 >>> 2 leaves us with 0010 0111 00.
        The 2 first bits are 0b00 == 0.
        We replace node with its first child, the one at index 0.
    We decrement level by 2, and set it to 0.
    As level is (finally) not over 0, we jump over the for loop.
    We mask key with the mask, and get back the bits 10. 
    We return the contents at index 2 from node.
\end{verbatim}

That is almost every single machine instruction you would have to
perform to lookup a value in a Clojure vector, with a depth of 5. Such
a vector would contain between 1 and 33 million elements. The fact
that the shifts and masks are some of the most efficient operations on
a modern CPU makes the whole deal even better. From a performance
perspective, the only "pain point" left on lookups are the cache
misses. For Clojure, that is handled pretty well by the JVM itself.

And that's how you do lookups in tries and in Clojure's vector
implementation. I would guess the bit operations are the hardest one
to grok, everything else is actually very straightforward. You just
need a rough understanding on how tries work, and that's it!

\defsection{Red Black Trees}

There is a special kind of binary search tree called a red-black tree.
It has the property that the longest path from the root to any leaf
is no more than twice as long as the shortest path from the root to
any other leaf.

In order to guarantee this property we construct a tree such that no
two connected nodes are red. The longest possible path will alternate
red and black nodes. The shortest path will be all black. Thus, the
two paths will differ by at most twice the length.

There are various rules defined (see Okasaki \cite{Oka98} p25 and
Wikipedia \cite{Wiki}). The Clojure implementation follows the Okasaki
model, which we will use as our background. Okasaki gives two rules
that are always true in a properly formed tree:

\begin{packeditemize}
\item No red node has a red child
\item Every path from the root to an empty node contains the same
number of black nodes.
\end{packeditemize}

\defsubsection{Persistence}
Driscoll defines a {\sl persistent} data structure as one that supports
mutliple versions. A data structure that allows only a single version
at a time is called {\sl ephemeral} \cite{DSST89}. 

The basic technique of creating a persistent data structure is to make
copies. However this is expensive in time and space. Driscoll shows
that data structures can be defined using {\bf links} between {\bf
nodes} where the nodes carry information and the links connect the nodes.
In such structures it is possible to only copy nodes that are changed
and update the links. Using this technique does not modify the old data
structure so the links can share portions of the old structure. Since
the old structure is not changed it is also available at the same time
as the new structure, albeit with different root nodes.

\defsubsection{Persistent Red Black Trees}

Okasaki has combined these two ideas to create Persistent Red Black
Trees. Each modification of the tree is done by making copies of changed
nodes but maintaining the red-black tree properties in the copy.

Since Clojure uses these persistent trees the actual tree is new copy, 
not a modified tree. We will now look into the details of how this
is done.

\defsubsection{Node Structure}
First we have to mirror Driscoll's concept of a {\bf Node}. This is
created in the code with a new Java abstract class called Node. Okasaki
requires that a node have 4 pieces of information, described as
{\tt T (Color, left, this, right)}. Thus we find that Nodes have
the ability to manipulate their left and right members. Thus, for the
left member we find:
\begin{packeditemize}
\item {\sl left} -- to return the left Node
\item {\sl addLeft} -- to add a left Node
\item {\sl removeLeft} -- to remove a left Node
\end{packeditemize}

and for the right member we find:
\begin{packeditemize}
\item {\sl left} -- to return the right Node
\item {\sl addLeft} -- to add a right Node
\item {\sl removeLeft} -- to remove a right Node
\end{packeditemize}

We have functions to set the color, {\sl blacken} and {\sl redden}.
We can ask this node for its {\sl key} and {\sl val}

Since every node has to maintain the Red-Black balance we have two
methods, {\sl balanceLeft} and {\sl balanceRight}. Note that these
methods always return a black node as the root of the red-black
tree is always black. 

We also have a method to replace this node, the {\sl replace} method. 

Some of the methods are abstract which means that any class
that implements a Node has to implement the following methods:
\begin{packeditemize}
\item Node addLeft(Node ins);
\item Node addRight(Node ins);
\item Node removeLeft(Node del);
\item Node removeRight(Node del);
\item Node blacken();
\item Node redden();
\item Node replace(Object key, Object val, Node left, Node right);
\end{packeditemize}

Since the data structure is persistent we need to copy
rather than modify the structure. Each implementation of this
abstract class has to handle the details.

Node assumes that it will return a Black node from its balance 
operations.

Nodes in a Clojure PersistentTreeMap have one of 8 possible 
subtypes of Node:
\begin{packeditemize}
\item Black - a black leaf node with a null value
\item BlackVal - a black leaf node with a value
\item BlackBranch - a black interior node with children and a null value
\item BlackBranchVal - a black interior node with children and a value
\item Red - a red leaf node with a null value
\item RedVal - a red leaf node with a value
\item RedBranch - a red interior node with children and a null value
\item RedBranchVal - a red interior node with children and a value
\end{packeditemize}

\defclass{Node}
\extends{Node}{AMapEntry}
\begin{chunk}{PersistentTreeMap Node Class}

    final Object key;

    }

    abstract Node replace(Object key, Object val, 
                          Node left, Node right);

}

\end{chunk}

\defsubsection{The Black Node implementation}
Since the Node class is abstract it has to have certain methods 
implemented in the extending class. 

We have two types of implementations, one for Red nodes and one for
Black nodes. Lets look at the Black node class. This is broken out
into a set of subclasses and we will drill down the chain for
implemention Black nodes.

The class {\sl Black} extends node and implements the abstract methods
of Node. This basically involves making sure that the subtrees
maintain their balance under the operations of adding and deleting
the subtrees. 

Black nodes assume they are black but they implement a method to 
change their color. Since it is a copy operation it returns a new
Red node as the result of {\sl redden}. 

Black nodes are the default color for a node so the Black class
does not have to do anything special for color.

There are 4 possible Black node types
\begin{packeditemize}
\item Black - a black leaf node with a null value
\item BlackVal - a black leaf node with a value
\item BlackBranch - a black interior node with children and a null value
\item BlackBranchVal - a black interior node with children and a value
\end{packeditemize}

A Black node is a leaf node with a null value. This is constructed by
PersistentTreeMap's \refto{black} method.

one of which could possibly be null. This is constructed by

    }

    Node redden(){
        return new RedBranchVal(key, val, left, right);
    }

}
\end{chunk}

\defsubsection{Constructing a Black Node}
We can construct a new black node given 4 parameters:
\begin{packeditemize}
\item key -- the TreeMap key
\item val -- the value stored in the TreeMap for this key
\item left -- a Node, possibly null
\item right -- a Node, possibly null
\end{packeditemize}

If both of the children are null we must be constructing a leaf node.
If the value is null we need only construct a naked {\sl Black} node,
otherwise we construct a {\sl BlackVal} node and store both the key
and the value.

If either of the children exist but have no value for this node
then construct a {\sl BlackBranch} internal tree node pointing at
the children.

If we have all four parameters then we have an internal node that
also has a value associated with it. Save the value and the children
in a {\sl BlackBranchVal} node.

\defmethod{PersistentTreeMap}{black}
\begin{chunk}{PersistentTreeMap black method}

    if(left == null && right == null)

    return new BlackBranchVal(key, val, left, right);

\defsubsection{The Red Node implementation}
The Red Node class differs from the Black node in many ways. In particular,
most of the operations return a new Red object whereas the Black node
implementation balances the subtrees.

Black nodes are the default color for a node so the Red class
has to return Red nodes for most operations.

There are 4 possible Red node types
\begin{packeditemize}
\item Red - a black leaf node with a null value
\item RedVal - a black leaf node with a value
\item RedBranch - a black interior node with children and a null value
\item RedBranchVal - a black interior node with children and a value

PersistentTreeMap's \refto{red} method.

If both of the children are null we must be constructing a leaf node.
If the value is null we need only construct a naked {\sl Red} node,
otherwise we construct a {\sl RedVal} node and store both the key

If either of the children exist but have no value for this node
then construct a {\sl RedBranch} internal tree node pointing at
the children.

If we have all four parameters then we have an internal node that
also has a value associated with it. Save the value and the children
in a {\sl RedBranchVal} node.

\defsubsection{Okasaki's balance cases}

Okasaki distinguishes 4 cases of balancing. It turns out that all four
cases balance to the same tree, which is hardly a surprise given
the constraints on the red-black alternation.

ML \cite{Wiki1, Har05} is a functional programming language and is
used by Okasaki to express his tree transformations.

Each case shows the ML code and the associated diagram. The ML code
represents a node as a 4-tuple of type {\bf T}. Thus we see a node as
\begin{verbatim}
   Type ( Color, leftnode, thisnode, rightnode )
\end{verbatim}
so we can read the first case as:

\defsubsection{Clojure's balance cases}

We find the {\sl leftBalance} handling the case where a red node
has a red node as its left child. There are three cases.

Case 1: The left child of a red node is red. We return new nodes
X, Y, and Z where
\begin{packeditemize}
\item X -- Node ( Red, 
\item Y
\item Z -- Node ( Black, 
\end{packeditemize}
\[
\begin{array}{rlc}
\pstree{\Tcircle{A}}
  { \Tcircle{B}
    \Tdot
  } & => &
\pstree{\Tcircle{X}}
  { \Tr{\pscirclebox[fillstyle=solid,fillcolor=black]{\color{white}Z}}
    \Tr{\pscirclebox[fillstyle=solid,fillcolor=black]{\color{white}Z}}
  }
\end{array}
\]

Case 2: The right child of a red node is red. We rewrite that as:
\[
\begin{array}{rlc}
\pstree{\Tcircle{N}}
  { \Tdot
    \Tcircle{B}
  } & => &
\pstree{\Tcircle{new}}
  { \Tr{\pscirclebox[fillstyle=solid,fillcolor=black]{\color{white}Z}}
    \Tr{\pscirclebox[fillstyle=solid,fillcolor=black]{\color{white}Z}}
  }
\end{array}
\]

Case 3: Both children of a red node are black. Rewrite the node black.
\[
\begin{array}{rlc}
\pstree{\Tcircle{N}}
  { \Tr{\pscirclebox[fillstyle=solid,fillcolor=black]{\color{white}B}}
    \Tr{\pscirclebox[fillstyle=solid,fillcolor=black]{\color{white}C}}

\refto{PersistentTreeMap} implements several subclasses to support the
interoperability with the rest of Clojure. These will not be explained
here. Refer to the other sections of this document for more details.
In particular, see \refto{Iterators} for methods of iterating across
keys and values. See \refto{Seqs} for information about manipulating
sequences over tree maps.

\defsection{Bit-Partitioned Hash Tries}
\label{bit-partitioning}

A trie is a data structure that exploits the fact that a prefix or
suffix has some regular pattern\cite{Bag00}. For instance, credit card
numbers have a fixed format. We can look at the set of 16 digit credit
card numbers which have the pattern AAAA-BBBB-CCCC-DDDD. Given this
sequence of 4 digit fields we can create a trie data structure for
fast lookup.

If we created a tree structure where the first level of lookup was the
first 4 digits AAAA we would have a maximum of 9999 possible first
level branches. If the second layer of the tree were based on BBBB
then it would also have a branching factor of 9999. We eventually get
a tree at most 4 layers deep that handle all $10^16$ possible values.

Alternatively we can reduce the fan-out by choosing 2 digits, so
AA gives a fan-out of 99 and this happens at each level. Now the
tree is 8 layers deep in order to contain all possible nodes.

Clojure has chosen a strategy based a bit pattern. So if we look
at the bits in groups of five we get this kind of a trie:

\vspace{9.5cm}

Notice that the trie has a fan-out of $2^5$ or 32 at each level except
the last. To contain all possible 32 bit values requires a trie of at
most depth 7. This means that a lookup will take at most 7 possible
fetches. For any reasonable set of numbers this is a near constant
time lookup.

One advantage of this scheme is the ability to mask out a subset of
the word, fully right-shift the bits, and use the resulting number
as an index into the array. Any masked off value has to be between
0 and 31 because the mask is 5 bits wide.

The 5 bit mask function is part of \refto{PersistentHashMap}. Given a
number of bits to shift right (a multiple of 5 appears to be used
everywhere) this routine returns a number between 0 and 31.

\defmethod{PersistentHashMap}{mask}
\begin{chunk}{PersistentHashMap mask method}
static int mask(int hash, int shift){
    //return ((hash << shift) >>> 27);// & 0x01f;
    return (hash >>> shift) & 0x01f;
}
\end{chunk}

This is used in the ArrayNode class. For instance, the {\sl find}
method 
\begin{packeditemize}
\item uses mask to get an index from 5 bits
\item uses that value to index into an array
\item if that entry is not set we didn't find it
\item shift 5 more bits right and search again.
\end{packeditemize}
\defmethod{ArrayNode}{find}
\begin{chunk}{ArrayNode find Object method}
    public Object find(int shift, int hash, Object key, 
                       Object notFound){
        int idx = mask(hash, shift);
        INode node = array[idx];
        if(node == null)
            return notFound;
        return node.find(shift + 5, hash, key, notFound); 
    }
\end{chunk}

Note that ArrayNode is a container class so it is actually recursively
calling the {\sl find} method on whatever was found in that container
slot. It might be anything that implements the INode interface:
\definterface{INode}
\extends{INode}{Serializable}
\begin{chunk}{PersistentHashMap INode interface}
static interface INode extends Serializable {
    INode assoc(int shift, int hash, Object key, 
                Object val, Box addedLeaf);

    INode without(int shift, int hash, Object key);

    IMapEntry find(int shift, int hash, Object key);

    Object find(int shift, int hash, Object key, Object notFound);

    ISeq nodeSeq();

    INode assoc(AtomicReference<Thread> edit, int shift, int hash, 
                Object key, Object val, Box addedLeaf);

    INode without(AtomicReference<Thread> edit, int shift, int hash, 
                  Object key, Box removedLeaf);
}
\end{chunk}

There are 3 classes that implement INode.
\begin{packeditemize}
\item \refto{ArrayNode}
\item \refto{BitmapIndexedNode}
\item \refto{HashCollisionNode}
\end{packeditemize}

Maps are associations of keywords and data. Hashmaps are untyped data
structures, as opposed to Records which carry their type.
\repl{(def tim \{:fname "Tim"\\
{\hbox {\hskip 1.8cm} :lname "Daly"}\\
{\hbox {\hskip 1.8cm} :address \{:street "Long Ridge Road"}\\
{\hbox {\hskip 3.3cm} :city "Pittsburgh"}\\
{\hbox {\hskip 3.3cm} :state "PA"}\\
{\hbox {\hskip 3.3cm} :zip 15022\}\}})}
{\#'user/tim}

We can look up by keyword since keywords are
\repl{(:lname tim)}{"Daly"}


We can nest access using the ``thread first'' operator which threads
arbitrary pieces of code (as opposed to ``..'' which threads Java classes).
\repl{(-$>$ tim :address :city)}{"Pittsburgh"}

We can create a new object with a change to a field.
\repl{(assoc tim :fname ``Timothy'')}{
\{:lname "Daly",\\
{\hbox {\hskip 0.1cm} :address \{:state "PA",}\\
{\hbox {\hskip 1.6cm} :city "Pittsburgh",}\\
{\hbox {\hskip 1.6cm} :street "Long Ridge Road",}\\
{\hbox {\hskip 1.6cm} :zip 15022\},}\\
{\hbox {\hskip 0.1cm} :fname "Timothy"\}}}

The {\tt update-in} function threads into a nested data structure
and then applies a function, in this case the {\tt inc} function.
This reduces the need to create intermediate classes.
\repl{(update-in tim [:address :zip] inc)}{
\{:lname "Daly",\\
{\hbox {\hskip 0.1cm} :address \{:state "PA",}\\
{\hbox {\hskip 1.6cm} :city "Pittsburgh",}\\

\defsection{Records}

Records carry their type, in this case ``Person'', as opposed to hashmaps
which are untyped data structures.
\repl{(defrecord Person [fname lname address])}{user.Person}

and in this case ``Address''
\repl{(defrecord Address [street city state zip])}{user.Address}

We can create a Var reference to a new record and set the address
field to be a new Address record.
\repl{
(def tim\\
{\hbox {\hskip 0.6cm} (Person. "Tim" "Daly"}\\
{\hbox {\hskip 0.8cm}
(Address. "Long Ridge Road" "Pittsburgh" "PA" 15022)))}}
{\#'user/tim}

Record field names are functions so we can use them as accessors.
\repl{(:lname tim)}{"Daly"}

And we can access them with the "thread first" operator which threads
through the set of accessors and then applies the function, in this case,
the {\tt inc} function. This is similar to the ``..'' operator except
that it applies to any kind of operator, not just Java operators.
\repl{(-$>$ tim :address :city)}{"Pittsburgh"}

\repl{(assoc tim :fname "Timothy")}{
\#:user.Person\{:fname "Timothy",\\
{\hbox {\hskip 2.2cm} :lname "Daly",}\\
{\hbox {\hskip 2.2cm} :address \#:user.Address\{}\\

{\bf --Stuart Halloway ``Clojure-Java Interp (Jan 19, 2011)''}}

{\bf Function Calling}

\begin{verbatim}
  (println "Hello Wikileaks")
\end{verbatim}

This is a list data structure with a first element of a Symbol
and a second element of a String. The first element is the function
to be called and the second element is the argument to that function.

{\bf Function Definition}

\begin{verbatim}
  (defn funname
   "documentation string of the function"
   [vector of arguments]
   (function arg1 ... argN))
\end{verbatim}

This is a list data structure with the elements:
\begin{packeditemize}
\item defn, a Symbol, used as a function to define a function
\item funname, a Symbol, used as the name of the new function
\item docstring, a String, used to document the function
\item argvec, a Vector of arguments to the new function
\item function, a Symbol, used as the name of some other function to call
\item arg1$\ldots$argN, a list of arguments to the function
\end{packeditemize}

For example,
\repl{(defn say "says the name and age" [name age] (str name " " age))}
{{\#'user/say}}

The defn function creates the new function called "say" which
takes 2 arguments and returns a string with the two arguments
separated by a space as in:
\repl{(say "Tim" 24)}{"Tim 24"}

You can add meta information to your programs to improve the
performance or simplify the runtime lookup of classes. The
syntax for metadata is a Symbol or hashmap prefixed by a caret \verb|^|.
For example, the say function returns a String so we could write
\begin{verbatim}
  (defn ^String say
   "says the name and age"
   [name age]
   (str name " " age))
\end{verbatim}

If the item after the caret is a single Symbol it is expanded into
a hashmap with the keyword :tag and the Symbol. In our case, this is
\verb|{:tag String}|

\defsubsection{Clojure calling Java}

{\bf Java ``new'' in Clojure}

{\bf Accessing a Java static member}

\end{verbatim}

{\bf Accessing instance members}

Since Clojure shifts the focus from the object to the function
we call, the Clojure syntax favors putting the function at the
head of the list, the so-called ``function'' position.
\begin{verbatim}
  rnd.nextInt()
\end{verbatim}
becomes
\begin{verbatim}
  (.nextInt rnd)
\end{verbatim}

{\bf Chaining function calls}
\begin{verbatim}
  person.getAddress().getZip()
\end{verbatim}
becomes
\begin{verbatim}
  (.. person getAddress getZip)
\end{verbatim}

The {\tt doto} macro uses the first form to create an object
upon which subsequent method calls can be applied in series.
\begin{verbatim}
  (doto (JFrame. "argument")
   (.add (proxy [JPanel] []))
   (.setSize 640 480)
   (.setVisible true))

\defsection{Identity and State}

Identity is a logical entity associated with a series of causally
related values, called states, over time. Identity is not a name
but can be named (e.g. my ``Mom'' is not your mom). Identity can
be a composite object (e.g. the New York Yankees). Programs that
are processes need identity. \cite{Hic10}

State is the value of an identity at a given time. Variables are
not sufficient to refer to a state because state could be composite.
This leads to a situation where, at a given time, the variable does
not refer to a properly formed state but refers to inconsistent
composite information. There is a lack of time coordination.

In order to properly capture state we need to incorporate some 
notion of time. Once we have time as a marker we can talk about
state at a particular time. Since Clojure deals with immutable
objects that implies that a changed state must be a different object
since things don't change in place. 

Since state is a combination of information and time it is possible
for multiple observers to query the state. Each will see a consistent
view of the information (the value) based on the time of the observation.

Clojure manages state by creating an intermediate object called a
reference. The reference object has atomic semantics. Changing a
reference happens as an all-or-nothing event. References are
essentially a pointer to a stateful object. The reference points at
the current state.  When a new state is being constructed as a
function of the old state there is no way to reference it until the
function completes. At that time the reference is atomically updated
and the new state can be observed as a wholly-formed object. This
becomes the new state which is a function of the current time and the
new information.  Observers of the prior state will still see the old
state unchanged.

There are four kinds of reference objects in Clojure which we will
discuss in detail below. These are {\sl vars}, {\sl atoms}, {\sl refs},
and {\sl agents}. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\defsection{Software Transactional Memory}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\defsection{Symbols}

Internally, a Clojure Symbol contains four pieces of data
\begin{packeditemize}
\item {\bf ns} an interned string of the namespace for this symbol
\item {\bf name} a interned string for this symbol name
\item {\bf hash} a hash of the name and the namespace
\item {\bf \_meta} meta data associated with this Symbol
\end{packeditemize}

\begin{chunk}{Symbol private data}
//these must be interned strings!
final String ns;
final String name;
final int hash;
final IPersistentMap _meta;
\end{chunk}

Java's String class has an {\sl intern} method \cite{Ora11} which returns
a canonical representation for the string object. The String class maintains
a pool of strings. When String's {\sl intern} method is invoked the pool is
searched for an {\sl equals} match. If the search succeeds then a reference
to the stored string is returned, otherwise the new string is added to the
pool and a reference to this String object is returned. Thus, the String
{\sl name} of a Symbol is a unique reference.

As pointed out in \cite{Web11}, Clojure creates a new Symbol for each
occurence it reads. The Symbols are not unique despite having equal names:
\begin{verbatim}
node2: clj
Clojure 1.3.0-alpha4
user=> (identical? 'a 'a)
false
user=> (= 'a 'a)
true
user=> (identical? (clojure.lang.Symbol/intern "a") 
       (clojure.lang.Symbol/intern "a"))
false
\end{verbatim}

\defmethod{Symbol}{intern}
\begin{chunk}{Symbol intern method}
static public Symbol intern(String nsname){
    int i = nsname.lastIndexOf('/');
    if(i == -1 || nsname.equals("/"))
      return new Symbol(null, nsname.intern());
    else
      return 
       new Symbol(nsname.substring(0, i).intern(), 
                  nsname.substring(i + 1).intern());
}

\end{chunk}

A new Symbol is automatically prepended with its namespace.
\begin{verbatim}
user=> (def a 1)
#'user/a
\end{verbatim}

\defmethod{Symbol}{intern(2)}
\begin{chunk}{Symbol intern method 2}
static public Symbol intern(String ns, String name){
    return new Symbol(ns == null ? null : ns.intern(), name.intern());
}
\end{chunk}

Since the namespace was null the current namespace {\tt user} was used.
We can see this from the {\sl toString} result.

\defmethod{Symbol}{toString}
\begin{chunk}{Symbol method toString}
public String toString(){
    if(ns != null)
        return ns + "/" + name;
    return name;
}
\end{chunk}

Since Symbols optionally include a namespace {\tt user/a}, which includes
a namespace,  and {\tt a} which does not include a namespace,
are different symbols but they name the same variable.

\begin{verbatim}
user=> (= 'user/a 'a)
false
user=> (def a 1)
#'user/a
user=> user/a
1
user=> (def user/a 2)
#'user/a
user=> a
2
\end{verbatim}

\defmethod{Symbol}{equals}
\begin{chunk}{Symbol method equals}
public boolean equals(Object o){
    if(this == o)
        return true;
    if(!(o instanceof Symbol))
        return false;

    Symbol symbol = (Symbol) o;

    //identity compares intended, names are interned
    return name == symbol.name && ns == symbol.ns;
}
\end{chunk}

\defsection{The Lisp Reader}

When the LispReader read function is invoked it reads each character
as an integer. The read function is parsing S-expressions so it skips
whitespace and fails if it does not get a complete S-expression. Numbers
are handled specially by the reader.

\defmethod{LispReader}{read}
\begin{chunk}{LispReader read method}

\defsubsection{Reader Syntax Macros}

Almost every special character is handled by looking up the special
function associated with that character in the {\tt macros} array:

\begin{chunk}{LispReader macros statement}
static IFn[] macros = new IFn[256];
\end{chunk}

The default values are specified in the syntax macro table. These are all
class objects that implement the \refto{IFn} interface which requires that
they have an {\tt invoke} method.

For the special case of the \verb|#| character there is a separate
table, the \refto{Dispatch Macro Table} which reads the next character
and calls another dispatch function. All of the special characters
get their meaning from these tables.

By default the special syntax characters are
\begin{packeditemize}
\item {\bf \verb|"|} a \refto{StringReader}
\item {\bf \verb|;|} a \refto{CommentReader}
\item {\bf \verb|'|} a \refto{WrappingReader}(QUOTE)

\item {\bf \verb|^|} a \refto{MetaReader}
\item {\bf \verb|`|} a \refto{SyntaxQuoteReader}

\defsection{Reader Dispatch Macros}

The \refto{LispReader} read function, when it encounters a \verb|#|
character indexes into the \refto{Syntax Macro Table} to find an
entry initialized to a \refto{DispatchReader} object.

\begin{chunk}{LispReader sharpsign macro statement}
    macros['#'] = new DispatchReader();
\end{chunk}

A DispatchReader reads the next character and uses it as an index
into the \refto{dispatchMacros} array. The reader function associated
with the macro character, in this case, is a \refto{VarReader}. This
gets assigned to {\tt fn} and then calls the {\tt invoke} method
of the \refto{VarReader} class.

The dispatchMacros array is defined to be an array of IFn objects.
The \refto{IFn} interface requires that all implementations have
to have an {\tt invoke} method, which VarReader has.
\label{dispatchMacros}
\index{dispatchMacros}
\begin{chunk}{LispReader dispatchMacros statement}
static IFn[] dispatchMacros = new IFn[256];
\end{chunk}

By default the special dispatch characters are:
\begin{packeditemize}
\item {\bf \verb|^|} a \refto{MetaReader}, 
for attaching meta information to objects
\item {\bf \verb|'|} a \refto{VarReader}, returns a Var object
\item {\bf \verb|"|} a \refto{RegexReader}, returns a regular expression
\item {\bf \verb|(|} a \refto{FnReader}, returns a function object
\item {\bf \verb|{|} a \refto{SetReader}, returns a set object
\item {\bf \verb|=|} a \refto{EvalReader}, returns an evaled object
\item {\bf \verb|!|} a \refto{CommentReader}, returns a commented object
\item {\bf \verb|<|} a \refto{UnreadableReader}, returns an unreadable object
\item {\bf \verb|_|} a \refto{DiscardReader}, returns a discarded object
\end{packeditemize}

These are all defined in this table and they are explained in the 
following sections.

\defsubsection{The Var reader macro}
Vars have a special reader macro \verb|#'| so that the input form
\verb|#'foo| expands into (var foo). The Symbol foo must be a Var
and the Var object itself, not its value, is returned.

The single-quote (\verb|'|) array entry contains a \refto{VarReader} function.
\begin{chunk}{LispReader dispatchMacros VarReader statement}
    dispatchMacros['\''] = new VarReader();
\end{chunk}

The VarReader {\sl invoke} method reads the next object and 
returns the Var reference.

The \verb|#'| macro is useful for naming functions or variables in 
another namespace. You can call function across namespaces by writing
\begin{verbatim}
  (#'mynamespace/functionname ...)

\defsection{Transients}

Transients are intended to make your code faster. Transients ignore
structural sharing so time and space is saved. The underlying data
structure is different. 

For example, we thread a persistent map through some associations.
\begin{chunk}{transients example}
(-> {} (assoc :a 1) (assoc :b 2) (assoc :c 3))
\end{chunk}
which results in the persistent map
\begin{chunk}{transients example}
{:c 3, :b 2, :a 1}
\end{chunk}

A {\bf transient} version is similar but transients are not mutable.
\begin{chunk}{transients example}
(-> (transient {}) (assoc! :a 1) (assoc! :b 2) (assoc! :c 3) persistent!)
\end{chunk}

\begin{chunk}{defn transient}
(defn transient 
  "Alpha - subject to change.
  Returns a new, transient version of the collection, in constant time."
  {:added "1.1"
   :static true}
  [^clojure.lang.IEditableCollection coll] 
  (.asTransient coll))

\end{chunk}

The difference is that the transient call makes the persistent map
is transformed to a transient map. The {\bf assoc!} call operates
similar to assoc. The {\bf persistent!} call transforms the result to
a persistent map.

There are several function that operate on transients, 
{\bf persistent!}, {\bf conj!}, {\bf assoc!}, {\bf dissoc!}, {\bf pop!},
and {\bf disj!}.

\begin{chunk}{defn persistent!}
(defn persistent! 
  "Alpha - subject to change.
  Returns a new, persistent version of the transient collection, in
  constant time. The transient collection cannot be used after this
  call, any such use will throw an exception."
  {:added "1.1"
   :static true}
  [^clojure.lang.ITransientCollection coll]
  (.persistent coll))

\end{chunk}

\begin{chunk}{defn conj!}
(defn conj!
  "Alpha - subject to change.
  Adds x to the transient collection, and return coll. The 'addition'
  may happen at different 'places' depending on the concrete type."
  {:added "1.1"
   :static true}
  [^clojure.lang.ITransientCollection coll x]
  (.conj coll x))

\end{chunk}

\begin{chunk}{defn assoc!}
(defn assoc!
  "Alpha - subject to change.
  When applied to a transient map, adds mapping of key(s) to
  val(s). When applied to a transient vector, sets the val at index.
  Note - index must be <= (count vector). Returns coll."
  {:added "1.1"
   :static true}
  ([^clojure.lang.ITransientAssociative coll key val]
   (.assoc coll key val))
  ([^clojure.lang.ITransientAssociative coll key val & kvs]
   (let [ret (.assoc coll key val)]
     (if kvs
       (recur ret (first kvs) (second kvs) (nnext kvs))
       ret))))

\end{chunk}

\begin{chunk}{defn dissoc!}
(defn dissoc!
  "Alpha - subject to change.
  Returns a transient map that doesn't contain a mapping for key(s)."
  {:added "1.1"
   :static true}
  ([^clojure.lang.ITransientMap map key] (.without map key))
  ([^clojure.lang.ITransientMap map key & ks]
   (let [ret (.without map key)]
     (if ks
       (recur ret (first ks) (next ks))
       ret))))

\end{chunk}

\begin{chunk}{defn pop!}
(defn pop!
  "Alpha - subject to change.
  Removes the last item from a transient vector. If
  the collection is empty, throws an exception. Returns coll"
  {:added "1.1"
   :static true}
  [^clojure.lang.ITransientVector coll] 
  (.pop coll)) 

\end{chunk}

\begin{chunk}{defn disj!}
(defn disj!
  "Alpha - subject to change.
  disj[oin]. Returns a transient set of the same (hashed/sorted) type,
  that does not contain key(s)."
  {:added "1.1"
   :static true}
  ([set] set)
  ([^clojure.lang.ITransientSet set key]
   (. set (disjoin key)))
  ([set key & ks]
   (let [ret (disj set key)]
     (if ks
       (recur ret (first ks) (next ks))
       ret))))

\end{chunk}

The imperative style will not work everywhere. For instance,
\begin{chunk}{transients example}
(let [a (transient {})]
  (dotimes [i 20] (assoc! a i i))
  (persistent! a))
\end{chunk}
returns with the broken result
\begin{chunk}{transients example}
(0 0, 1 1, 2 2, 3 3, 4 4, 5 5, 6 6, 7 7}
\end{chunk}
which is only the first 8 values of the map.

However, if it is done in a recursive style, as in 
\begin{chunk}{transients example}
(persistent!
  (reduce (fn[m v] (assoc! m v v))
          (transient {})
          (range 1 21)))
\end{chunk}
yields all twenty pairs.
\begin{chunk}{transients example}
(0 0, 1 1, 2 2, 3 3, 4 4, 5 5, 6 6, 7 7, 8 8, 9 9, 10 10, 11 11, 12 12,
13 13, 14 14, 15 15, 16 16, 17 17, 18 18, 19 19, 20 20)
\end{chunk}

Transients can only be modified by the thread that creates them.
Attemping to access them will throw a
\verb|java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException|
\begin{chunk}{transients example}
@(let [c (transient [])] (future (conj! c :a)))
\end{chunk}

It is also not possible to modify a Transient after the call to
{\bf persistent!} will throw a 
\verb|java.lang.IllegalAccessError| exception. So this will not work:
\begin{chunk}{transients example}
(let [c (transient #{})] (persistent! c) (conj! c :a))
\end{chunk}

Transients do not work on every data structure. Lists, sets, and maps
all throw a
\verb|java.lang.ClassCastException|
\begin{chunk}{transients example}
(transient '())
(transient (sorted-set))
(transient (sorted-map))
\end{chunk}

The Transient data structure must support 
\verb|clojure.lang.IEditableCollection|.

\defsection{Promise and Deliver}

A Promise is a mechanism for storing data and reading this data across
threads. 

The {\bf promise} function creates a promise that can be stored as in:
\begin{chunk}{promise example}
(def prom (promise))
\end{chunk}

\begin{chunk}{defn promise}
(defn promise
  "Alpha - subject to change.
  Returns a promise object that can be read with deref/@, and set,
  once only, with deliver. Calls to deref/@ prior to delivery will
  block. All subsequent derefs will return the same delivered value
  without blocking."
  {:added "1.1"
   :static true}
  []
  (let [d (java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch. 1)
        v (atom nil)]
    (reify 
     clojure.lang.IDeref
      (deref [_] (.await d) @v)
     clojure.lang.IPromiseImpl
      (hasValue [this]
       (= 0 (.getCount d)))
     clojure.lang.IFn
      (invoke [this x]
        (locking d
          (if (pos? (.getCount d))
            (do (reset! v x)
                (.countDown d)
                this)
            (throw (IllegalStateException. 
                    "Multiple deliver calls to a promise"))))))))

\end{chunk}

To fulfill a promise we use the {\bf deliver} function. So we would use
\begin{chunk}{promise example}
(deliver prom 1)
\end{chunk}

\begin{chunk}{defn deliver}
(defn deliver
  "Alpha - subject to change.
  Delivers the supplied value to the promise, releasing any pending
  derefs. A subsequent call to deliver on a promise will throw an 
  exception."
  {:added "1.1"
   :static true}
  [promise val] (promise val))

\end{chunk}

\index{promise}{dereference}
\index{promise}{@}
\index{@}{promise}
To see the delivered value we deference the variable.
\begin{chunk}{promise example}
@prom
\end{chunk}
Note that dereferencing a promise before the value is delivered
will block the current thread. So you can have a future deliver
on the promise from another thread and wait on the result.
\begin{chunk}{promise example}
(do (future
     (Thread/sleep 5000)
     (deliver prom 1))
 @prom)
\end{chunk}

\index{promise}{IllegalStateException}
\index{exceptions}{IllegalStateException}
\index{IllegalStateException}{promise}
Attemping to deliver a value more than once will throw a
\verb|java.lang.IllegalStateException|

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\defsection{Futures}

Futures are a mechanism for executing a function in a different thread
and retrieving the results later.

Futures are useful for long running tasks that should not block, such
as a UI thread, communicating across networks, or a task that has 
a side-effect that does not affect the main computation, such as 
displaying an image or printing. For example,
\begin{chunk}{future example}
(do 
  (future
    (Thread/sleep 3000)
    (sendToPrinter "resume.pdf"))
  (messages/plain-message "file being printed"))
\end{chunk}

A future can return a value. We define a var that will hold the
value of a future as in:

\begin{chunk}{defn future-call}
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; futures (needs proxy);;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
(defn future-call 
  "Takes a function of no args and yields a future object that will
  invoke the function in another thread, and will cache the result and
  return it on all subsequent calls to deref/@. If the computation has
  not yet finished, calls to deref/@ will block."
  {:added "1.1"
   :static true}
  [f]
  (let [f (binding-conveyor-fn f)
        fut (.submit clojure.lang.Agent/soloExecutor ^Callable f)]
    (reify 
     clojure.lang.IDeref 
      (deref [_] (.get fut))
     java.util.concurrent.Future
      (get [_] (.get fut))
      (get [_ timeout unit] (.get fut timeout unit))
      (isCancelled [_] (.isCancelled fut))
      (isDone [_] (.isDone fut))
      (cancel [_ interrupt?] (.cancel fut interrupt?)))))

\end{chunk}

\begin{chunk}{defmacro future}  
(defmacro future
  "Takes a body of expressions and yields a future object that will
  invoke the body in another thread, and will cache the result and
  return it on all subsequent calls to deref/@. If the computation has
  not yet finished, calls to deref/@ will block."
  {:added "1.1"}
  [& body] `(future-call (^{:once true} fn* [] ~@body)))

\end{chunk}

\begin{chunk}{future var}
(def result
  (future
   (Thread/sleep 3000)
   "The future has arrived"))
\end{chunk}

\index{future}{dereference}
\index{future}{@}
\index{@}{future}
We can get the value of this var using the dereference operator "@".
\begin{chunk}{future dereference}
@result
\end{chunk}

\index{future}{CancellationException}
\index{exceptions}{CancellationException}
\index{CancellationException}{future}
If we dereference the var before the future completes then the
dereference blocks until the result is available. The result
retains its value so a second dereference will return immediately.
If the future is cancelled (see below), then the dereference will

\defsection{Defrecord}

Define a record object with slots named :a, :b, and :c
\repl{(defrecord Foo [a b c])}{user.Foo}

This makes a Java class {\tt Foo} in the Java package {\tt user}.

Make a Var reference to a our new record object.
\repl{(def f (Foo. 1 2 3))}{\#:user.Foo\{:a 1, :b 2, :c 3\}}

Access the value of the :b slot in the record instance f
\repl{(:b f)}{2}
or
\repl{(.b f)}{2}

What is the Var f actually pointing to? It points to a class object.
\repl{(class f)}{user.Foo}

We can apply normal functions to the query information about the
class of f.
\repl{(supers (class f))}{

Defprotocol defines a named set of generic functions which dispatch on
the type of the first argument. The functions are defined in the same
namespace (and thus the same Java package) as the protocol.

Similar to Java interfaces but are functions, not associated with classes.
In this example, we mimic the Java idioms. A record is like class and
coerce is like an interface so we are saying that the class {\tt Name}
implements the {\tt as-file} method of interface {\tt coerce}.

{\bf Extending inline}

{\bf Extending protocol to classes that already exist}

Protocols can implement methods without classes by associating them
with types of their first argument. So we extend the {\tt coerce}

\section{The Simulation World}
The first part of {\bf ants.clj} sets up the simulation world, where we'll
be introduced to some of Clojure's powers.

\subsection{Initial setup of constants/magic-numbers}
After the copyright notice, the initial setup code of {\bf ants.clj} is
easy to understand (for coders at least), even if you've never dealt
with Lisp before. We see parameters (aka constants and magic numbers)
being defined for later use using Clojure's special form: {\bf def}
creates a var (a mutable storage location) which connects a symbol to
a value in the current {\bf namespace}.

(def animation-sleep-ms 100)
(def ant-sleep-ms 40)
(def evap-sleep-ms 1000)
  
(def running true)
\end{chunk}

\subsection{The board: ready to mutate via transactions}
Things get more interesting once the actual simulation environment
needs defining: 
\begin{chunk}{cell}
(defstruct cell :food :pher)  ; May also have :ant and :home values

\end{chunk}

First, a call to {\bf defstruct} (like a hashmap or dictionary in other
languages) defines a baseline {\sl cell}. 
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf defstruct} is like a very lightweight class or
constructor/template function, and conveniently wraps Clojure's
{\bf create-struct}.
\item Here, a cell has two keys to start, {\bf :food} and {\bf :pher}, to
indicate the presence of food and pheromones. A cell may also have
keys of {\bf :ant} and {\bf :home}, depending on whether an ant and/or the
home-colony is present.
\end{itemize}

Next, the {\bf world} function creates the 2-dimensional "board" of cells
(here, a square of 80x80 cells), represented as vectors (rows or the
vertical y-dimension) of a vector (the horizontal x-dimension columns
in one row):
\begin{chunk}{sim-world-board-creation}
;; World is a 2d vector of refs to cells
(def world 
     (apply vector 
            (map (fn [_] 
                   (apply vector
                          (map (fn [_]
                                 (ref (struct cell 0 0))) 
                               (range dim)))) 
                 (range dim))))

\end{chunk}
Reading the above:
\begin{itemize}
\item Start with the innermost {\bf map} call, which uses an anonymous
function to create one column of 80 cells, per {\bf (range dim)}. The
{\bf struct} returns a new structmap instance using the earlier cell as
the basis, initializing the {\bf :food} and {\bf :pher} values to zero.
\item But notice that {\bf struct} is wrapped with a {\tt transactional ref}, 
and here's the first glimpse of Clojure's concurrency powers. With
each cell being stateful (possibly time-varying values of {\bf :food},
{\bf :pher}, {\bf :ant}, and {\bf :home} values) and with multiple threads
updating the board and board elements, we'd typically think of
using locks on each cell when updating its state.

But in Clojure with its {\tt software transactional memory} (STM), we
just use {\bf ref} for safe references to mutable collections (here, a
{\bf struct}) - all changes to a cell will then be atomic, consistent,
and isolated!
\footnote{STM is like a memory-only SQL database, thus the last property of
being durable/persistent won't be satisfied.}
Like using an RDBMS, you don't need to manually manage concurrency.
\item Once you understand the innermost {\bf (ref (struct cell 0 0 ))} 
{\bf map} call, the rest of {\bf (def world...)} is straightforward: 
{\bf apply} uses {\bf vector} as a constructor function with the {\bf map}
function producing the vector's arguments, creating a ``column'' in the 2-D
board.
\item Then the pattern is repeated in the outermost 
{\bf (apply vector (map...))} call, creating all the columns of the
2-D board.
\item Note that as defined, each vector in {\bf world} (again, a 2-D vector of
vectors) corresponds to an x-position, and of course, within that
vector are the y-positions (here, a total of 80 cells).
\end{itemize}

The {\bf place} function is a selector function (think of ``place'' as the
noun, not the verb) returning particular cells in the 2-D world. Once
we have a cell, we can then mutate it to represent ants, food, and
pheromones (or their absence):
\begin{chunk}{place}
(defn place [x y]
  (-> world (nth x) (nth y)))

\end{chunk}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf place} takes a single vector argument (having two elements x and
y), then applies the {\sl thrush operator} (the arrow-like $->$) on the
world object, first selecting the ``column'' {\bf (nth x)} on world, then
the ``row'' {\bf (nth y)} on that column.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Aside: the thrush operator}
The thrush operator helps make code more concise, and arguably
clearer: instead of reading code ``inside-out'' to mentally evaluate it,
we can read it left-to-right.
\footnote{Apparently Clojure's thrush is not quite a true
thrush, see Michael Fogus' article at 
blog.fogus.me/2010/09/28/thrush-in-clojure-redux}
Consider how the
equivalent {\bf place} function would look without thrushing:

\begin{verbatim}
(defn place-verbose [[x y]]
  (nth (nth world x) y))
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Ants as agents - doing asynchronous uncoordinated changes}
Next we'll consider the ``active things'' in {\bf ants.clj}, the ants
themselves. As before, we start with {\bf defstruct}, defining an ant as
having only one required key, its direction. (An ant may temporarily
have another key, {\bf :food}.)

\begin{chunk}{ants-defined}
(defstruct ant :dir)  ; Always has dir heading; may also have :food

(defn create-ant 
  "Create an ant at given location, returning an ant agent on the location."
  [location direction]
    (sync nil
      (let [the-place (place location)
            the-ant (struct ant direction)]
        (alter the-place assoc :ant the-ant)
        (agent location))))

\end{chunk}

To explain the above constructor function for ants, {\bf create-ant}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Takes two arguments, {\bf location} and {\bf direction}. {\bf location} 
will be a vector {\bf [x y]}, and as we saw, passed on to the place function as
an argument; {\bf direction} is a number from 0-7 inclusive
corresponding to one of the eight cardinal directions.
\item More concurrency support: the {\tt sync function} takes a flags argument
(as of Clojure 1.3, it's still ignored so just pass nil), and then a
list of expressions that will be executed together atomically (all
or nothing) as a transaction.
\item The {\tt let special form} binds pairs of symbols and expressions in its
arguments vector, providing local, lexical bindings within the scope
of the body following.
\item {\bf sync} will ensure that any mutations of refs using the 
{\tt alter function} will be atomic. Previously we had used {\bf ref} 
around each cell, so in the above code where {\bf the-place} is such a 
ref-wrapped cell, {\bf alter} takes {\bf the-place} ref as its first argument,
then {\bf assoc} as the function to be {\bf apply}'ed on the-place, tying a 
new ant instance to it (remember that as a cell, {\bf the-place} is sure to 
have {\bf :food} and {\bf :pher} key-values already, now we add {\bf :ant}). 
Like the thrush operator earlier, the syntax of {\bf alter} enables convenient
left-to-right reading.
\item Finally, the {\tt agent function}. What are Clojure agents? To quote the
docs, 
\begin{quote}
Agents provide shared access to mutable state. They allow
non-blocking (asynchronous as opposed to synchronous atoms) and
independent change of individual locations (unlike coordinated
change of multiple locations through refs).
\end{quote}
\end{itemize}

Clojure's {\bf agent} function takes one required argument of state,
returning an agent object with initial value of that given state.
Here, as the last line of {\bf create-ant}, {\bf agent} effectively returns
the ant object at its starting location. Ants as agents make sense:
we expect them to move around independently (i.e. asynchronously) in
the simulation world.

\subsection{Setting up the home, and ants}
The home of the ants is not a single cell on the world-board, but a
square of cells, with its top-left corner offset from the origin (0,
0). Its sides are proportional to the number of ants because the home
square will initially contain all the ants - one ant per cell - before
the simulation runs. We can see these two aspects of the home-square
in the two {\bf def} calls for {\bf home-offset} and {\bf home-range} below.

\begin{chunk}{home-setup}
(def home-offset (/ dim 4))
(def home-range (range home-offset (+ nants-sqrt home-offset)))

(defn setup 
  "Places initial food and ants, returns seq of ant agents."
  []
  (sync nil
    (dotimes [i food-places]
      (let [p (place [(rand-int dim) (rand-int dim)])]
        (alter p assoc :food (rand-int food-range))))
    (doall
     (for [x home-range y home-range]
       (do
         (alter (place [x y]) assoc :home true)
         (create-ant [x y] (rand-int 8)))))))

\end{chunk}

The {\bf setup} function's docstring tells us what it's doing, so on to
the details:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf setup} takes no arguments.
\item As we saw before in {\bf create-ant}, the {\bf sync} function wraps a
sequence of expressions that together should be executed atomically,
all-or-nothing.
\item Setup initial food: The {\bf dotimes} function takes two arguments, the
first a vector {\bf [name n]} with {\bf n} being the number of times that
the {\bf body} (the second argument) will be repeatedly executed,
usually for its side-effects/mutations.
\begin{itemize}
\item Here, the unused name {\bf i} is bound to the integers from 0 to 34,
since we had specified food-places as 35 initially.
\item The {\bf body} is clear enough: bind {\bf p} to the randomly chosen place
on the world-board (using the {\bf rand-int} function for (x, y). The
already-seen {\bf alter} function modifies that {\bf p} to have a random
amount of food value.
\end{itemize}
\item Placing the ants in their starting positions: The {\bf doall} function
forces immediate evaluation of a lazy sequence - in this case the
lazy sequence produced by the {\bf for} function.
\begin{itemize}
\item Here, the {\bf for} function's first argument is: two
binding-form/collection-expr pairs for every x and y position
within the square of the ants' home.
\item The {\bf for} function's second argument is the body-expression, here
wrapped in the {\bf do} special form which ensures order of evaluation
(usually, of expressions having side-effects): designate the place
as a home position, then create an ant on that place with a random
initial direction.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

In sum, the {\bf setup} function shows how to deal with state and its
mutation in Clojure: we started with a 2-D world-board of places
(cells) as Clojure refs; then we modify/mutate each place using
{\bf alter}. We can use various looping functions such as {\bf dotimes} and
{\bf doall} to process a batch of state-mutations (of the world-board)
atomically and consistently.

\subsection{Orientation and moving around the world}
Next, consider facing/orientation and moving to another place in the
2-D world. Three functions below, followed by explanations:

\begin{chunk}{world-wrapping}
(defn bound 
  "Returns given n, wrapped into range 0-b"
  [b n]
  (let [n (rem n b)]
    (if (neg? n) 
      (+ n b) 
      n)))

;; Directions are 0-7, starting at north and going clockwise. These are
;; the 2-D deltas in order to move one step in a given direction.
(def direction-delta {0 [0 -1]
                      1 [1 -1]
                      2 [1 0]
                      3 [1 1]
                      4 [0 1]
                      5 [-1 1]
                      6 [-1 0]
                      7 [-1 -1]})

(defn delta-location 
  "Returns the location one step in the given direction. Note the
  world is a torus."
  [[x y] direction]
  (let [[dx dy] (direction-delta (bound 8 direction))]
    [(bound dim (+ x dx)) (bound dim (+ y dy))]))

\end{chunk}

With the 2-D world board, we have the 8 cardinal directions (North,
North-East, East, etc.), and board edges that wrap-around to the
opposite side - like the old arcade games of the 1980's, e.g. {\tt Pac-Man}
and {\tt Asteroids}. The functions {\bf bound} and {\bf delta-location} 
help enforce these world-behaviors, while the definition of 
{\bf direction-delta} maps a movement in a cardinal direction to the 
corresponding change in x and y. A few comments on each:
\begin{itemize}
\item The {\bf bound} function using the built-in {\bf rem} (i.e. remainder)
function is straightforward. Observe how {\bf bound} is used in
delta-location to ensure wrap-around behavior in: 1) cardinal
directions; 2) the world-board, at its edges given by {\bf dim}.
\item {\bf direction-delta} maps the eight cardinal directions (0 is North) to
the corresponding changes in {\bf [x y]}. Note the syntax: it's an
array-map literal, where the order of insertion of key-value pairs
(here, keys 0-7) will be preserved.
\item {\bf delta-location} takes the current {\bf [x y]} 
location and a direction, returning the new corresponding location 
on the world-board.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ant-agent behavior functions}
In Hickey's simulation, ants need to move (rotation and translation),
pick up and drop-off food, and make rudimentary decisions.

\subsubsection{Ant movements}
Our ants need two behaviors to get around their world: turning (or
changing the direction they ``face''), and stepping forward.  Let's deal
with turning first:

\begin{chunk}{ant-agent-turn}
;ant agent functions
; An ant agent tracks the location of an ant, and controls the
; behavior of the ant at that location.

(defn turn 
  "Turns the ant at the location by the given amount."
  [loc amt]
  (dosync
   (let [p (place loc)
         ant (:ant @p)]
     (alter p assoc :ant (assoc ant :dir (bound 8 (+ (:dir ant) amt))))))
  loc)

\end{chunk}

The {\bf turn} function takes two arguments, location and the amount of
turn. What's interesting is the usage of the {\bf dosync} function, which
ensures the ant's turn - the changes of state within the {\bf assoc}
function calls - is all-or-nothing. The ant gets a new direction per
the innermost {\bf assoc}, then the outermost {\bf assoc} updates the 
{\bf place} with the updated ant.

Now for actual movement to a new place:

\begin{chunk}{ant-agent-move}
(defn move 
  "Moves the ant in the direction it is heading. Must be called in a
  transaction that has verified the way is clear."
  [startloc]
  (let [oldp (place startloc)
        ant (:ant @oldp)
        newloc (delta-location startloc (:dir ant))
        newp (place newloc)]
    ;; move the ant
    (alter newp assoc :ant ant)
    (alter oldp dissoc :ant)
    ;; leave pheromone trail
    (when-not (:home @oldp)
      (alter oldp assoc :pher (inc (:pher @oldp))))
    newloc))

\end{chunk}

The {\bf move} function changes state of both the ant and board, thus the
doc-string note that it must be called in a transaction. The code is
self-explanatory, though if ``pheromone'' is a new term to you, you'll
want to learn about a dominant form of chemical communication on
Earth. Whenever our artificial ant is not within its home, it will
``secrete'' pheromone ({\bf inc} the {\bf :pher} value by 1) at the place it
just left, making it easier (more likely) for it and other ants to
travel between home and food locations in the future (instead of doing
a completely random walk).

\subsubsection{Ants and food}
When an ant finds food, it ``picks up'' one unit of it; when it returns
home with a food unit, it will ``drop'' its food there. These two
interactions (each having two steps) change the board, and as with the
{\bf move} function, they need to occur atomically (all-or-nothing) to
ensure the world is in a consistent state. 

\begin{chunk}{ant-agent-food}
(defn take-food [loc]
  "Takes one food from current location. Must be called in a
  transaction that has verified there is food available."
  (let [p (place loc)
        ant (:ant @p)]    
    (alter p assoc 
           :food (dec (:food @p))
           :ant (assoc ant :food true))
    loc))

(defn drop-food [loc]
  "Drops food at current location. Must be called in a
  transaction that has verified the ant has food."
  (let [p (place loc)
        ant (:ant @p)]    
    (alter p assoc 
           :food (inc (:food @p))
           :ant (dissoc ant :food))
    loc))

\end{chunk}

Notice how similar the structure is for the two functions above;
possibly they're candidates for macro refactoring.

\subsubsection{Ant judgment}
Our ants need some decision-making for their overall task of finding
food and bringing it home.  As we'll see shortly, an ant's behavior
is based on two states, either:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The ant does not have food, and is looking for it. In this mode, it
weighs the three map locations ahead of it (ahead, ahead-left,
ahead-right) by the presence of either food or pheromone.
\item The ant has food, and needs to bring it to the home box/location.
Now it weighs which of the three ahead-positions to take by the
presence of pheromone, or home.
\end{enumerate}

So we need functions to express preference of the next location for an
ant. The functions {\bf rank-by} and {\bf wrand} help with that.

\begin{chunk}{ant-agent-judgment-1}
(defn rank-by 
  "Returns a map of xs to their 1-based rank when sorted by keyfn."
  [keyfn xs]
  (let [sorted (sort-by (comp float keyfn) xs)]
    (reduce (fn [ret i] (assoc ret (nth sorted i) (inc i)))
            {} (range (count sorted)))))

\end{chunk}

The {\bf rank-by} function gives weights to where an ant will move next in
the simulation world. It takes two arguments, {\bf keyfn} and {\bf xs} - but
what do those args look like, and where is {\bf rank-by} used? In the
{\bf behave} function below; you'll see that the {\bf keyfn} checks for the
presence of {\bf :food}, {\bf :pher}, or {\bf :home} - in the three cells 
(board locations) of the {\bf xs} vector of 
{\bf [ahead ahead-left ahead-right]}.
\footnote{Remember that {\bf :food}, {\bf :pher}, and {\bf :home} are mutually 
exclusive in a cell. When an ant wants to go home with food, and the 
home cell(s) is ahead of it, it will always go home, there won't be 
competing {\bf :pher} presence.}
\begin{itemize}
\item The {\bf (sort-by keyfn coll)} function 
returns a sorted sequence of items
in coll, ordered by comparing {\bf (keyfn item)}. Here, for the local
value sorted, it will be ascending order of cells/places, by
their :food/:home/:pher values - each of those is valuable to an ant
depending on whether it's looking for food, or bringing it home.
\item The {\bf (reduce f initial-val coll)} functionn in its 3-arguments form
here has its 1st argument {\bf f} as a function taking two arguments, the
current/initial-val value and the next/first item from coll. In this
case, it will ``build-up'' a map from the local sorted value, with the
keys being the ranked cells/places, and the values being integers 1,
2 and 3. To get a sense of what's going on, try this on your Clojure
REPL:
\begin{verbatim}
  (let [sorted [0 0.7 1.0]] 
    (reduce (fn [ret i] (assoc ret (nth sorted i) (inc i)))
            {} 
            (range (count sorted))))
  ;; You should see {1.0 3, 0.7 2, 0 1}
  ;; 
  ;; Within the behave function below, the return value might be
  ;; like {<cell-ahead-left> 3, <cell-ahead-right> 2, <cell-ahead> 1} 
  ;; or similar.

\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}

Next: The {\bf wrand} function helps with the larger task of randomizing
which location/cell the ant moves to next in a weighted manner; i.e.
the ``dice'' are loaded with {\bf rank-by}, then ``rolled'' here:

\begin{chunk}{ant-agent-judgment-2}
(defn wrand 
  "Given a vector of slice sizes, returns the index of a slice given a
  random spin of a roulette wheel with compartments proportional to
  slices."
  [slices]
  (let [total (reduce + slices)
        r (rand total)]
    (loop [i 0 sum 0]
      (if (< r (+ (slices i) sum))
        i
        (recur (inc i) (+ (slices i) sum))))))

\end{chunk}

How is {\bf wrand} used? Like {\bf rank-by}, look in the {\bf behave} function:
its single argument of slices is a vector of 3 integers (from
{\bf rank-by} above), corresponding to the relative desirability of the 3
cells ahead of the ant. So if the slices argument looked like {\bf [0 3 1]}, 
that would correspond to zero probability of moving ahead, and
3/4 chance moving to the ahead-left cell over the ahead-right cell.
\begin{itemize}
\item The {\bf let} value {\bf total} uses {\bf reduce} to set the upper 
bound on the random number; loosely like setting the maximum number of faces on
the die to be rolled (albeit that some die numbers are geometrically
impossible).
\item The {\bf rand} function returns a random floating point number from 0
(inclusive) to n (exclusive).
\item Here's the only looping construct in the entire ants program: it's
analogous to checking which compartment of the roulette wheel the
ball fell in. The {\bf if} checks if {\bf r} "fell into" the current
pocket - the size of which is given by {\bf (slices i)}. If yes, return
the index corresponding to that pocket; if not, check the next
pocket/slice.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Tying it all together: the {\bf behave} function for ants}
The {\bf behave} function below is the largest one, so it helps to keep in
mind its main parts while diving into details:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf let} values - help with readability.
\item {\bf Thread/sleep} - helps slow down ants in the UI display.
\item {\bf dosync} - ensures ants behavior is transactional, all-or-nothing.
\item {\bf if} branch: main logic for an ant, if ant has {\bf :food} take it
   home, otherwise look for food.
\end{enumerate}

Also, consider the context of how {\bf behave} is first used: within the
main invocation at the end, there's the expression:

\begin{verbatim}
(dorun (map #(send-off % behave) ants))
\end{verbatim}

So the {\bf behave} function is called on every ant agent via the 
{\bf send-off} function, which is how Clojure dispatches potentially 
blocking actions
to agents. And there certainly are potentially blocking actions when
using {\bf behave}, since ants may try to move into the same cell, try to
acquire the same food, etc.

\begin{chunk}{ant-agent-behave}
(defn behave 
  "The main function for the ant agent."
  [loc]
  (let [p (place loc)
        ant (:ant @p)
        ahead (place (delta-location loc (:dir ant)))
        ahead-left (place (delta-location loc (dec (:dir ant))))
        ahead-right (place (delta-location loc (inc (:dir ant))))
        places [ahead ahead-left ahead-right]]
    ;; Old way of Java interop: (. Thread (sleep ant-sleep-ms))
    ;; New idiomatic way is,
    (Thread/sleep ant-sleep-ms)
    (dosync
     (when running
       (send-off *agent* #'behave))
     (if (:food ant)
       ;; Then take food home:
       (cond 
        (:home @p)                              
          (-> loc drop-food (turn 4))
        (and (:home @ahead) (not (:ant @ahead))) 
          (move loc)
        :else
          (let [ranks (merge-with + 
                        (rank-by (comp #(if (:home %) 1 0) deref) places)
                        (rank-by (comp :pher deref) places))]
          (([move #(turn % -1) #(turn % 1)]
            (wrand [(if (:ant @ahead) 0 (ranks ahead)) 
                    (ranks ahead-left) (ranks ahead-right)]))
           loc)))
       ;; No food, go foraging:
       (cond 
        (and (pos? (:food @p)) (not (:home @p))) 
          (-> loc take-food (turn 4))
        (and (pos? (:food @ahead)) (not (:home @ahead)) (not (:ant @ahead)))
          (move loc)
        :else
          (let [ranks (merge-with + 
                                  (rank-by (comp :food deref) places)
                                  (rank-by (comp :pher deref) places))]
          (([move #(turn % -1) #(turn % 1)]
            (wrand [(if (:ant @ahead) 0 (ranks ahead)) 
                    (ranks ahead-left) (ranks ahead-right)]))
           loc)))))))

\end{chunk}

{\bf The {\sl let} values}

The {\bf let} values: quite straightforward, just note the twist in how
{\bf behave} receives a cell/location as its argument, not an ant (which
an OO-centric design might expect).

{\bf The only JVM/concurrency leakage: Thread/sleep}

The 
\begin{verbatim}
(. Thread (sleep ant-sleep-ms))
\end{verbatim}
or
\begin{verbatim}
(Thread/sleep ant-sleep-ms) 
\end{verbatim}
call is our first encounter
with {\tt Clojure's Java Interop}. 
\begin{itemize}
\item The first version uses the {\bf dot} special form 
and in particular, the 
\begin{verbatim}
(. Classname-symbol (method-symbol args*)) 
\end{verbatim}
format, with {\bf Thread} as the Classname-symbol, 
and {\bf sleep} as the method-symbol.
\item However, outside of macros, the idiomatic form for accessing method
members is the second form, 
\begin{verbatim}
(Classname/staticMethod args*)
\end{verbatim}
\item Beyond syntax, the point of this expression is to slow down an ant
(one ant-agent per thread) between their movements, so you can see
in the UI what they're doing, and they'll appear more realistic. 
\end{itemize}

But more interesting still: in this highly concurrent program, the
{\bf sleep} expression is about the *only explicit reference to threads*
in the entire code, i.e. one of the very few ``leaky abstractions''
hinting at Clojure's use of underlying JVM concurrency constructs.
Besides this call, there are no locks, and no explicit thread
allocations.

{\bf The main dosync call}

Next, let's look at what's going on within the {\bf dosync} transaction.

{\bf Repeating asynchronously, without looping}

The first expression is:
\begin{verbatim}
(when running (send-off *agent* #'behave))
\end{verbatim}

Initially this may seem strange; aren't we in the {\bf behave} function
because {\bf send-off} already called it before entering it? Won't this
just loop uselessly, not hitting the core {\bf if} code below? Not quite:
\begin{itemize}
\item Instead, {\bf send-off} adds another execution of {\bf behave} to the
current agent's *queue* of work/functions, and immediately returns.
\begin{itemize}
\item The current agent is referenced by the asterisk-surrounded
*agent* which Clojure dynamically binds to the current active
agent on a thread-local basis.
\end{itemize}
\item Thus after finishing this call of {\bf behave} the ant will do another
action (execute {\bf behave} again), and another, and so on. No explicit
looping, just *queue and repeat*.
\end{itemize}

Also, note the \verb|#'| sharp-quote, before {\bf behave}; this is a Clojure
Var, one of Clojure's mutable reference types. It's just syntactic
sugar for {\bf (var behave)}. Invoking a Var referring to a function is
the same as invoking the function itself...so why bother with it?  I
don't know; here's what I could find:
\begin{itemize}
\item Besides Clojure docs, this SO thread also suggests there's no
difference, ``Apply a {\bf var} is the same as applying the value store
in the {\bf var}.''
\item Maybe the \verb|#'| prefix on {\bf behave} causes the current 
thread's value of the function (with the current ant/location) to be sent 
to the queue? NO/unlikely. If it was mean to be a dynamic var, it would
have asterisks around it like {\bf *agent*}.
\item Another possibility is that the \verb|#'| maintains a runtime look-up so
that {\bf behave} can be redefined on a running simulation while developing.
\end{itemize}

Why use {\bf send-off} instead of {\bf send}?
\begin{itemize}
\item send vs. send-off - {\bf send} uses threadpool of fixed size which has
low switching overhead but blocking can dry up the threadpool. By
contrast, {\bf send-off} uses a dynamic threadpool and blocking is
tolerated - and that's the right approach here as ant contention for
the same location/food can certainly cause (temporary) blocking.
\end{itemize}

{\bf Determining what the ant does next}

Finally, the ant's logic for what to do next is in the large {\bf if}
expression. The code looks dense but at the top level it's just a
binary choice:
\begin{itemize}
\item If the ant has food, take it home; the {\bf cond} specifies 3 sub-cases: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item At a home cell, drop the food and turn around 180 degrees, to
exit home for more food.
\item If a home cell is ahead, move to it.
\item Otherwise, do a ranking of cells ahead ({\bf places} has the cells
{\bf ahead}, {\bf ahead-left}, {\bf ahead-right}) per presence of pheromones,
or home, and then randomly select from those 3 cells per their 
ranking/weighting.
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{World behavior: pheromone evaporation}
\begin{chunk}{evaporate}
(defn evaporate 
  "Causes all the pheromones to evaporate a bit."
  []
  (dorun 
   (for [x (range dim) y (range dim)]
     (dosync 
      (let [p (place [x y])]
        (alter p assoc :pher (* evap-rate (:pher @p))))))))

\end{chunk}

For a bit of realism and a cleaner UI/visual, it's useful to have the
ants' pheromones diminish and evaporate from the world over time.
The {\bf evaporate} function fulfills that requirement: 
\begin{itemize}
\item It takes no arguments, it will work over the entire world/board of
cells, accessed via the tuples of {\bf x} and {\bf y}.
\item The {\bf dorun} function takes a lazy collection/sequence (here, that of
the {\bf for} expression) and forces the realization of that collection
for its side effects, discarding any returned values.
\begin{itemize}
\item It's unlike the similarly-named {\bf doall} where we do care about the
values.
\item And it's unlike {\bf doseq}, which is like Clojure's {\bf for} but runs
immediately and does not collect the results.
\end{itemize}
\item {\bf dosync} is used as before, for lock-free updating of a {\bf place}
cell.  Here, the desired side-effect/``mutation'' is to update the
{\bf :pher} value at the {\bf place} cell with a lower number.  
\end{itemize}

We'll see shortly that {\bf evaporate} will run every second, a process
that (like the ants) will be handled asynchronously using a Clojure
agent.

\section{The UI}
The user interface for the ants relies heavily on Clojure's Java
inter-operation capabilities. But as we'll see, it's more than just
wrapping calls to Java.

\subsection{Using the Java AWT}
\begin{chunk}{clojureUI}
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; UI ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

(import 
 '(java.awt Color Graphics Dimension)
 '(java.awt.image BufferedImage)
 '(javax.swing JPanel JFrame))

\end{chunk}

The {\bf import} pulls in classes from {\sl Java's Abstract Window Toolkit}
(AWT) package, and from the Java Swing package. Assuming unfamiliarity with 
Java Swing, let's describe the classes used:
\begin{itemize}
\item The {\bf Color} class encapsulates a color in the standard RGB color
space. In the code below, its usage as a constructor for a color
instance follows several arities:
\begin{itemize}
\item 4 integer arguments: r, g, b, and a for the alpha/transparency (0
transparent, 255 opaque)
\item 3 integer arguments: r g b
\item 1 argument: not a constructor call, but an access of a predefined
static {\bf Color} field by name, returning the color in the RGB color space.
\end{itemize}
\item The {\bf Graphics} class is an abstract base class for all graphics
contexts, i.e. a {\bf Graphics} instance holds the current state data
needed for rendering it: the {\bf Component} object on which to draw,
the current clip, color, and font, etc. Below, we'll see that the
Clojure functions that take a {\bf Graphics} instance as an argument:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf fill-cell}
\item {\bf render-ant}
\item {\bf render-place}
\item {\bf render}
\end{itemize}
$\ldots$all do some kind of rendering/drawing.
\item The {\bf Dimension} class encapsulates the integer width and height of a
component. This class is used just once below, in setting the size
of the panel of the UI.
\item {\bf BufferedImage} class is needed for raster image data; below, the
{\bf render} function uses it to paint the background panel.
\item The {\bf JPanel} class is the generic ``lightweight'' UI 
container in Java Swing (seems like the {\bf div} element in HTML).  
Below, it's used just once for the main display.
\item The {\bf JFrame} class creates a top-level window (w/ title and border)
in Swing; it's used just once below for the main ants UI window.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Functions to render the board and the ants}
Each discrete cell on the world board is a square matrix of pixels;
with an odd number of pixels chosen, we can have a central position:
\begin{chunk}{UI-scale}
;pixels per world cell
(def scale 5)

\end{chunk}

By default, cells are empty; drawing cells having food or
ant-deposited pheromones is done by filling with symbolic colors -
here by running the Java methods {\bf setColor} and {\bf fillRect}:
\begin{chunk}{UI-fill-cell}
(defn fill-cell [#^Graphics g x y c]
  (doto g
    (.setColor c)
    (.fillRect (* x scale) (* y scale) scale scale)))

\end{chunk}
Note the use of the {\bf doto} function here and in many places below: in
Java, procedural mutation of a newly constructed instance is common
for initialization. Clojure's {\bf doto} function is meant to be more
concise in specifying the target object just once, and then
methods/setters acting on it and then returning it, implicitly.

Drawing an ant: the graphical appearance of an ant is just a (5-pixel
long) line pointing in one of the 8 cardinal directions, of two
different colors (having food or not):
\begin{chunk}{UI-render-ant}
(defn render-ant [ant #^Graphics g x y]
  (let [black (. (new Color 0 0 0 255) (getRGB))
        gray (. (new Color 100 100 100 255) (getRGB))
        red (. (new Color 255 0 0 255) (getRGB))
        [hx hy tx ty] ({0 [2 0 2 4]  ; Up/North pointing
                        1 [4 0 0 4] 
                        2 [4 2 0 2] 
                        3 [4 4 0 0] 
                        4 [2 4 2 0]  ; Down/South 
                        5 [0 4 4 0] 
                        6 [0 2 4 2] 
                        7 [0 0 4 4]}
                       (:dir ant))]
    (doto g
      (.setColor (if (:food ant) 
                  (new Color 255 0 0 255) 
                  (new Color 0 0 0 255)))
      (.drawLine (+ hx (* x scale)) (+ hy (* y scale)) 
                (+ tx (* x scale)) (+ ty (* y scale))))))

\end{chunk}
Note the cleverly concise destructuring for the start and end drawing
coordinates, needed in AWT's {\bf drawLine} method.

If a cell in the ants' world is not empty, it has one or more of three
things present: pheromone, food, or an ant.  The {\bf render-place}
function updates the cell's appearance accordingly:
\begin{chunk}{UI-render-place}
(defn render-place [g p x y]
  (when (pos? (:pher p))
    (fill-cell g x y (new Color 0 255 0 
                          (int (min 255 (* 255 (/ (:pher p) pher-scale)))))))
  (when (pos? (:food p))
    (fill-cell g x y (new Color 255 0 0 
                          (int (min 255 (* 255 (/ (:food p) food-scale)))))))
  (when (:ant p)
    (render-ant (:ant p) g x y)))

\end{chunk}

Finally, the {\bf render} function ties everything together: initializing
the UI/window appearance by applying {\bf render place} to every cell, and
also drawing the home space of the ants.  Note the heavy usage of the
dot special form: the UI code relies heavily on Java, though Clojure's
{\bf for} and {\bf doto} help us avoid Java boilerplate and stay concise:
\begin{chunk}{UI-render}
(defn render [g]
  (let [v (dosync (apply vector (for [x (range dim) y (range dim)] 
                                   @(place [x y]))))
        img (new BufferedImage (* scale dim) (* scale dim) 
                 (. BufferedImage TYPE_INT_ARGB))
        bg (. img (getGraphics))]
    ;; First paint everything white, on the bg instance:
    (doto bg
      (.setColor (. Color white))
      (.fillRect 0 0 (. img (getWidth)) (. img (getHeight))))
    (dorun 
     (for [x (range dim) y (range dim)]
       (render-place bg (v (+ (* x dim) y)) x y)))
    ;; Draw the home space of the ants:
    (doto bg
      (.setColor (. Color blue))
      (.drawRect (* scale home-offset) (* scale home-offset) 
                 (* scale nants-sqrt) (* scale nants-sqrt)))
    (. g (drawImage img 0 0 nil))
    (. bg (dispose))))  ; Finished using Graphics object, release it.

\end{chunk}

\subsection{Setting the scene, then updating it continually}
Almost ready to begin our simulation; we need to setup some additional
elements per AWT conventions: the main UI {\bf panel} where visual changes
take place, the top-level window {\bf frame}, and an {\bf animator} agent that
continually updates the visual elements:
\begin{chunk}{UI-panel}
(def panel (doto 
             (proxy [JPanel] [] (paint [g] (render g)))
             (.setPreferredSize (new Dimension 
                                     (* scale dim) 
                                     (* scale dim)))))

(def frame (doto (new JFrame) (.add panel) .pack .show))

\end{chunk}

\subsubsection{Animation, panel-by-panel}
Now for bringing the static starting ``picture'' to life - like the
cartoons of old, the {\bf animation} function will ``draw'' the next state
of the main panel displaying the ants.  Below, Hickey uses the
queue-itself-then-run, again-and-again code pattern we've seen before
(above, in updating an ant's state):
\begin{chunk}{UI-animation}
(def animator (agent nil))

(defn animation [x]
  (when running
    (send-off *agent* #'animation))
  (. panel (repaint))
  (. Thread (sleep animation-sleep-ms))
  nil)

\end{chunk}

Finally, we need another agent to handle one more time-track of
changes: evaporation, using the {\bf evaporate} function defined above.
\begin{chunk}{UI-evaporation}
(def evaporator (agent nil))

(defn evaporation [x]
  (when running
    (send-off *agent* #'evaporation))
  (evaporate)
  (. Thread (sleep evap-sleep-ms))
  nil)

\end{chunk}

\section{Running the Program}
\subsection{Running the simulator}
At the REPL, you can enter the entire {\bf do} expression below, or try
each line within it separately:
\begin{chunk}{runtheprogram}
(do 
  (load-file "./literate-ants.clj")
  (def ants (setup))
  (send-off animator animation)
  (dorun (map #(send-off % behave) ants))
  (send-off evaporator evaporation))

\end{chunk}
Either way you'll see a new window appear with a white background,
blue square representing the ants' home, red squares of food, black or
red (w/ food) moving lines representing each ant, and green squares
for pheromones in various concentrations.  A lot happening
concurrently, with no locks, and beautifully concise code - welcome to
Clojure!

\chapter{Parallel Processing}

\defsection{Natural Graphs}

Could we do massively parallel work in ``native'' lisp (i.e. not just a
swig cover for MPI). Could we develop a lisp graph data structure that
was designed to be run in parallel with multiple processes (aka closures,
continuations) ``owning'' subgraphs and using the subgraph edges leaving
their ``clades'' as natural communication paths? That way we could develop
a  ``natural map'' from the graph to the available resources.

It raises interesting questions, such as how to dynamically allocate
the graph map to nodes transparently, similar to the way garbage
collection is now transparent. This would allow Lisp programs to
be written against the graph and run in parallel without knowing
about parallel issues. The immutable data structures and STM would help
with the coordination and state issues.

The combination of a processor and a subgraph is called a ``clade'',
similar to the idea of calling a processor and a program a ``process''.

\defsection{Steele's parallel ideas}

From Steele \cite{Ste09} we find the following ideas:

\begin{packeditemize}
\item effective parallelism uses trees
\item associative combining operators are good
\item mapreduce is good
\item catamorphisms are good
\item there are systematic strategies for parallizing sequential code
\item we must lose the accumulator paradigm
\item we must emphasize divide and conquer
\end{packeditemize}

Contrast good sequential code and good parallel code

\begin{packeditemize}
\item good sequential code minimizes total number of operations
\begin{packeditemize}
\item clever tricks to reuse previously computed results
\item good parallel code often performs redundant operations to reduce
communication
\end{packeditemize}
\item good sequential algorithms minimize space usage
\begin{packeditemize}
\item clever tricks to reuse storage
\item good parallel code often requires extra space to permit
temporal decoupling
\end{packeditemize}
\item sequential idioms stress linear problem decomposition
\begin{packeditemize}
\item process on thing at a time and accumulate results
\item good parallel code usually requires multiway problem
\end{packeditemize}
\end{packeditemize}

\begin{packeditemize}
\item linearly linked lists are inherently sequential
\begin{packeditemize}
\item compare peano arithmetic: 5 = ((((0+1)+1)+1)+1)+1
\item binary arithmetic is much more efficient than unayr
\end{packeditemize}
\item we need a multiway decomposition paradigm
\begin{verbatim}
   length [ ] = 0
   length [a] = 1
   length (a++b) = (length a) + (length b)
\end{verbatim}
\end{packeditemize}
This is just a summation problem: adding up a bunch of 1's!

Total work: $\Theta(n)$

Delay: $\Omega(log\ n)$, $O(n)$ depending on how a++b is split
even worse if splitting has worse than constant cost

{\bf Thoughts}

What you want to do versus how you want to do it.

Give the compiler wiggle room. The wiggle room concept is based on the
idea that certain mathematical properties allow the compiler to rewrite
a computation into a parallel form. So the idea of associativity, which
allows terms of an expression to be grouped in arbitrary ways without
affecting the computation allows us to rewrite
\begin{verbatim}
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8
\end{verbatim}
as
\begin{verbatim}
((1 + 2) + (3 + 4)) + ((5 + 6) + (7 + 8))
\end{verbatim}
which then allows the compiler to add the subterms and then add their
results. Steele identifies several mathematical 
properties that the compiler can exploit:
\begin{packeditemize}
\item associativity
\item commutativity
\end{packeditemize}


What are the parallel operators. 
Which of these parallel operators are thinking vs implementation.

Could the add tree be log 32 since add can be multi-arg?
Is there a mapping from persistent trees to parallel code?

Clojure could partition tasks based on log32. A better, more fine
grained alternative is to use \refto{bit-partitioning} to split 
tasks based on the size of the task and the number of processors.
That is,
\begin{verbatim}
  (partition chunksize processors)
\end{verbatim}

Concatenation lists give wiggle room. That is, 
\begin{packeditemize}
\item \verb|<>| is the empty list
\item \verb|<23>| is a singleton list
\item \verb?< a || b >? is a concatenation of a and b
\end{packeditemize}
so
\begin{verbatim}
<<23 || 47> || <18 || 11>>
\end{verbatim}
\pstree{\Tr{\psframebox{$\ ||\ $}}}
  { \pstree{\Tr{\psframebox{$\ ||\ $}}}
    { \Tr{\psframebox{23}}
      \Tr{\psframebox{47}}
    }
    \pstree{\Tr{\psframebox{$\ ||\ $}}}
    { \Tr{\psframebox{18}}
      \Tr{\psframebox{11}}
    }
  }

but the same list could be:
\begin{verbatim}
<<<23 || 47> || 18> || 11>
\end{verbatim}

\pstree{\Tr{\psframebox{$\ ||\ $}}}
  { \pstree{\Tr{\psframebox{$\ ||\ $}}}
    { \pstree{\Tr{\psframebox{$\ ||\ $}}}
      { \Tr{\psframebox{23}}
        \Tr{\psframebox{47}}
      }
      \Tr{\psframebox{18}}
    }
    \Tr{\psframebox{11}}
  }

or
\begin{verbatim}
<<23 || <47 || <>>> || <18 || <<> || 11>>>
\end{verbatim}
\pstree{\Tr{\psframebox{$\ ||\ $}}}
 { \pstree{\Tr{\psframebox{$\ ||\ $}}}
   { \Tr{\psframebox{23}}
     \pstree{\Tr{\psframebox{$\ ||\ $}}}
     { \Tr{\psframebox{47}}
       \Tr{\psframebox{$/$}}
     }
   }
   \pstree{\Tr{\psframebox{$\ ||\ $}}}
   { \Tr{\psframebox{18}}
     \pstree{\Tr{\psframebox{$\ ||\ $}}}
     { \Tr{\psframebox{$/$}}
       \Tr{\psframebox{11}}
     }
   }
 }

or
\begin{verbatim}
<23 || <47 || <18 || <11 || <>>>>>
\end{verbatim}
\pstree{\Tr{\psframebox{$\ ||\ $}}}
  { \Tr{\psframebox{23}}
    \pstree{\Tr{\psframebox{$\ ||\ $}}}
    { \Tr{\psframebox{47}}
      \pstree{\Tr{\psframebox{$\ ||\ $}}}
      { \Tr{\psframebox{18}}
        \pstree{\Tr{\psframebox{$\ ||\ $}}}
        { \Tr{\psframebox{11}}
          \Tr{\psframebox{$/$}}
        }
      }
    }
  }

\defsection{Sequential mapreduce}
For the list form Steele defines three operators, map, reduce, and mapreduce.
They are:
\begin{chunk}{Steele map}
(define (map f xs)                   ; linear in (length xs)
 (cond ((null? xs) '())
       (else (cons (f (car xs)) (map f (cdr xs))))))
\end{chunk}
so, for example,

(map ($\lambda$ (x) (* x x)) '(1 2 3)) $\Rightarrow$ (1 4 9)

\begin{chunk}{Steele reduce}
(define (reduce g id xs)             ; linear in (length xs)
 (cond ((null? xs) id)
       (else (g (car xs) (reduce g id (cdr xs))))))
\end{chunk}
so, for example,

(reduce + 0 '(1 4 9)) $\Rightarrow$ 14

\begin{chunk}{Steele mapreduce}
(define (mapreduce f g id xs)        ; linear in (length xs)
 (ocnd ((null? xs) id)
       (else (g (f (car xs)) (mapreduce f g id (cdr xs))))))
\end{chunk}
so, for example,

(mapreduce ($\lambda$ (x) (* x x)) + 0 '(1 2 3)) $Rightarrow$ 14

\begin{chunk}{Steele length}
(define (length xs)                  ; linear in (length xs)
 (mapreduce (lambda (q) 1) + 0 xs))
\end{chunk}

Using structural recursion, we can define filter as:
\begin{chunk}{Steele filter}
(define (filter p xs)                ; linear in (length xs)
 (cond ((null? xs) '())
       ((p (car xs)) (cons p (filter p (cdr xs))))
       (else (filter p (cdr x)))))
\end{chunk}

Alternatively we could map the predicate down the list:
\begin{chunk}{Steele filter 2}
(define (filter p xs)                ; linear in (length xs)??
 (apply append
  (map (lambda (x) (if (p x) (list x) '())) xs)))
\end{chunk}

Or, by using mapreduce
\begin{chunk}{Steele filter 3}
(define (filter p xs)          ; linear in (length xs)!!
 (mapreduce (lambda (x) (if (p x) (list x) '()))
            append '() xs))    ; each call to append is constant time
\end{chunk}

The reverse function could be defined structurally as:
\begin{chunk}{Steele reverse 1}
(define (reverse xs)                 ; quadratic in (length xs)
 (cond ((null? xs) '())
       (else (addright (reverse (cdr xs)) (car xs)))))
\end{chunk}

Or we could define a new function, revappend, by using the accumulator
trick to reduce the time complexity from quadratic to linear.
\begin{chunk}{Steele revappend}
(define (revappend xs ys)            ; linear in (length xs)
 (cond ((null? xs) ys)
       (else (revappend (cdr xs) (cons (car xs) ys)))))
\end{chunk}

and use it to define reverse:
\begin{chunk}{Steele reverse 2}
(define (reverse xs)                 ; linear in (length xs)
 (revappend xs '()))
\end{chunk}

\defsubsection{Parallel mapreduce}
\begin{chunk}{Steele parallel mapreduce}
(define (mapreduce f g id xs)        ; logarithmic in (length xs)??
 (ocnd ((null? xs) id)
       ((singleton? xs) (f (item xs)))
       (else (split xs (lambda (ys zs)
              (g (mapreduce f g id ys)       ; opportunity for
                 (mapreduce f g id zs))))))) ; parallelism
\end{chunk}

\begin{chunk}{Steele parallel map}
(define (map f xs)
 (mapreduce (lambda (x) (list (f x))) append '() xs)) ; or conc
\end{chunk}

\begin{chunk}{Steele parallel reduce}
(define (reduce g id xs)
 (mapreduce (lambda (x) x) g id xs))
\end{chunk}

\begin{chunk}{Steele parallel length}
(define (length xs)                  ; logarithmic in (length xs)??
 (mapreduce (lambda (q) 1) + 0 xs))
\end{chunk}

\begin{chunk}{Steele parallel filter}
(define (filter p xs)                ; logarithmic in (length xs)??
 (mapreduce (lambda (x) (if (p x) (list x) '()))
            append '() xs))
\end{chunk}

\begin{chunk}{Steele parallel reverse}
(define (reverse xs)                 ; logarithmic in (length xs)??
 (mapreduce list (lambda (ys zx) (append zs ys)) '() xs))
\end{chunk}

\begin{packeditemize}
\item for filter, unlike summation, we rely on maintaining the original
order of the elements in the input list. Thus $||$ and $+$ are associative,
but only $+$ is commutative.
\item do not confuse the ordering of elements in the result list (which is
a spatial order) with the order in which they are computed (which is a 
temporal order)
\item sequential programming often ties spatial order to temporal order
\item it is incorrect to say that since I don't pay attention to the
order in which things are done then we require commutativity. But
commutativity has to do with the spatial ordering in the result, not the
temporal order in which they are computed.
\end{packeditemize}

Steele defines ``Conjugate Transforms'' which, instead of mapping input
items directly to the output data type T:
\begin{packeditemize}
\item map inputs (maybe by way of T) to a richer data type U
\item perform the computation in this richer space U (chosen to make
computation simpler or faster)
\item finally, project the result from U back into T
\end{packeditemize}

Thought: he is just wrapping T with a structure for side information

Thought: much effort needs to be placed on the combining operator

/**
 * Information about the input and output stack map frames of a basic 
 * block.
 *
 * @author Eric Bruneton
 */
final class Frame{

/*
     * Frames are computed in a two steps process: during the visit 
     * of each instruction, the state of the frame at the end of 
     * current basic block is updated by simulating the action of 
     * the instruction on the previous state of this so called 
     * "output frame". In visitMaxs, a fix point algorithm is used 
     * to compute the "input frame" of each basic block, i.e. the 
     * stack mapframe at the begining of the basic block, starting 
     * from the input frameof the first basic block (which is 
     * computed from the method descriptor),and by using the 
     * previously computed output frames to compute the input 
     * state of the other blocks.
     *
     * All output and input frames are stored as arrays of 
     * integers. Reference and array types are represented by an 
     * index into a type table (which is not the same as the constant 
     * pool of the class, in order to avoid adding unnecessary 
     * constants in the pool - not all computed frames will end up 
     * being stored in the stack map table). This allows very fast 
     * type comparisons.
     *
     * Output stack map frames are computed relatively to the input 
     * frame of the basic block, which is not yet known when output 
     * frames are computed. It is therefore necessary to be able to 
     * represent abstract types such as "the type at position x in 
     * the input frame locals" or "the type at position x from the 
     * top of the input frame stack" or even "the type at position 
     * x in the input frame, with y more (or less) array dimensions". 
     * This explains the rather complicated type format used in 
     * output frames.
     *
     * This format is the following: DIM KIND VALUE (4, 4 and 24 
     * bits). DIM is a signed number of array dimensions (from -8 to 
     * 7). KIND is either BASE, LOCAL or STACK. BASE is used for 
     * types that are not relative to the input frame. LOCAL is used 
     * for types that are relative to the input local variable types. 
     * STACK is used for types that are relative to the input stack 
     * types. VALUE depends on KIND. For LOCAL types, it is an index 
     * in the input local variable types. For STACK types, it is a 
     * position relatively to the top of input frame stack. For BASE 
     * types, it is either one of the constants defined in 
     * FrameVisitor, or for OBJECT and UNINITIALIZED types, a tag 
     * and an index in the type table.
     *
     * Output frames can contain types of any kind and with a 
     * positive or negative dimension (and even unassigned types, 
     * represented by 0 - which does not correspond to any valid 
     * type value). Input frames can only contain BASE types of 
     * positive or null dimension. In all cases the type table 
     * contains only internal type names (array type descriptors 
     * are forbidden - dimensions must be represented through the 
     * DIM field).
     *
     * The LONG and DOUBLE types are always represented by using 
     * two slots (LONG + TOP or DOUBLE + TOP), for local variable 
     * types as well as in the operand stack. This is necessary to 
     * be able to simulate DUPx_y instructions, whose effect would 
     * be dependent on the actual type values if types were always 
     * represented by a single slot in the stack (and this is not 
     * possible, since actual type values are not always known - 
     * cf LOCAL and STACK type kinds).

     * to resize another one, which may require to resize yet another 
     * one, and so on. The first step of the algorithm consists in 
     * finding all  the instructions that need to be resized, without 
     * modifying the code. This is done by the following "fix point" 
     * algorithm:
     *
     * Parse the code to find the jump instructions whose offset will 
     * need more than 2 bytes to be stored (the future offset is 
     * computed from the current offset and from the number of bytes 
     * that will be inserted or removed between the source and target 
     * instructions). For each such instruction, adds an entry in (a 
     * copy of) the indexes and sizes arrays (if this has not already 
     * been done in a previous iteration!).
     *
     * If at least one entry has been added during the previous step, go
     * back to the beginning, otherwise stop.
     *
     * In fact the real algorithm is complicated by the fact that the 
     * size of TABLESWITCH and LOOKUPSWITCH instructions depends on their
     * position in the bytecode (because of padding). In order to ensure 
     * the convergence of the algorithm, the number of bytes to be added 
     * or removed from these instructions is over estimated during the 
     * previous loop, and computed exactly only after the loop is 
     * finished (this requires another pass to parse the bytecode of 
     * the method).

 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 * The serialVersionUID is computed using the signature of a stream of 
 * bytes that reflect the class definition. The National Institute of 
 * Standards and Technology (NIST) Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-1) is 
 * used to compute a signature for the stream. The first two 32-bit 
 * quantities are used to form a 64-bit hash. A 
 * java.lang.DataOutputStream is used to convert primitive data types 
 * to a sequence of bytes. The values input to the stream are defined 
 * by the Java Virtual Machine (VM) specification for classes.
 * <p/>
 * The sequence of items in the stream is as follows:
 * <p/>
 * 1. The class name written using UTF encoding.
 * 2. The class modifiers written as a 32-bit integer.
 * 3. The name of each interface sorted by name written using UTF 
 *    encoding.
 * 4. For each field of the class sorted by field name (except 
 *    private static and private transient fields):
 * 1. The name of the field in UTF encoding.
 * 2. The modifiers of the field written as a 32-bit integer.
 * 3. The descriptor of the field in UTF encoding
 * 5. If a class initializer exists, write out the following:
 * 1. The name of the method, &lt;clinit&gt;, in UTF encoding.
 * 2. The modifier of the method, java.lang.reflect.Modifier.STATIC,
 * written as a 32-bit integer.
 * 3. The descriptor of the method, ()V, in UTF encoding.
 * 6. For each non-private constructor sorted by method name and 
 *    signature:
 * 1. The name of the method, &lt;init&gt;, in UTF encoding.
 * 2. The modifiers of the method written as a 32-bit integer.
 * 3. The descriptor of the method in UTF encoding.
 * 7. For each non-private method sorted by method name and signature:
 * 1. The name of the method in UTF encoding.
 * 2. The modifiers of the method written as a 32-bit integer.
 * 3. The descriptor of the method in UTF encoding.
 * 8. The SHA-1 algorithm is executed on the stream of bytes produced by
 * DataOutputStream and produces five 32-bit values sha[0..4].
 * <p/>
 * 9. The hash value is assembled from the first and second 32-bit 
 * values of the SHA-1 message digest. If the result of the message 
 * digest, the five 32-bit words H0 H1 H2 H3 H4, is in an array of 
 * five int values named sha, the hash value would be computed as 
 * follows:
 * <p/>
 * long hash = ((sha[0] &gt;&gt;&gt; 24) &amp; 0xFF) |
 * ((sha[0] &gt;&gt;&gt; 16) &amp; 0xFF) &lt;&lt; 8 |
 * ((sha[0] &gt;&gt;&gt; 8) &amp; 0xFF) &lt;&lt; 16 |
 * ((sha[0] &gt;&gt;&gt; 0) &amp; 0xFF) &lt;&lt; 24 |
 * ((sha[1] &gt;&gt;&gt; 24) &amp; 0xFF) &lt;&lt; 32 |

(defn require
  "Loads libs, skipping any that are already loaded. Each argument is
  either a libspec that identifies a lib, a prefix list that identifies
  multiple libs whose names share a common prefix, or a flag that 
  modifies how all the identified libs are loaded. Use :require in 
  the ns macro in preference to calling this directly.

  Libs

  A 'lib' is a named set of resources in classpath whose contents 
  define a library of Clojure code. Lib names are symbols and each 
  lib is associated with a Clojure namespace and a Java package that 
  share its name. A lib's name also locates its root directory within 
  classpath using Java's package name to classpath-relative path 
  mapping. All resources in a lib should be contained in the directory 
  structure under its root directory. All definitions a lib makes 
  should be in its associated namespace.

  'require loads a lib by loading its root resource. The root resource 
  path is derived from the lib name in the following manner:
  Consider a lib named by the symbol 'x.y.z; it has the root directory
  <classpath>/x/y/, and its root resource is <classpath>/x/y/z.clj. The 
  root resource should contain code to create the lib's namespace 
  (usually by using the ns macro) and load any additional lib resources.

  Libspecs

  A libspec is a lib name or a vector containing a lib name followed 
  by options expressed as sequential keywords and arguments.

  Recognized options: :as
  :as takes a symbol as its argument and makes that symbol an alias 
    to the lib's namespace in the current namespace.

  Prefix Lists

  It's common for Clojure code to depend on several libs whose names 
  have the same prefix. When specifying libs, prefix lists can be 
  used to reduce repetition. A prefix list contains the shared prefix 
  followed by libspecs with the shared prefix removed from the lib 
  names. After removing the prefix, the names that remain must not 
  contain any periods.

  Flags

  A flag is a keyword.
  Recognized flags: :reload, :reload-all, :verbose
  :reload forces loading of all the identified libs even if they are
    already loaded
  :reload-all implies :reload and also forces loading of all libs that 
    the identified libs directly or indirectly load via require or use
  :verbose triggers printing information about each load, alias, and 
    refer

  Example:

  The following would load the libraries clojure.zip and clojure.set
  abbreviated as 's'.

 (reify options* specs*)
  
  Currently there are no options.

  Each spec consists of the protocol or interface name followed by zero
  or more method bodies:

  protocol-or-interface-or-Object
  (methodName [args+] body)*

  Methods should be supplied for all methods of the desired
  protocol(s) and interface(s). You can also define overrides for
  methods of Object. Note that the first parameter must be supplied to
  correspond to the target object ('this' in Java parlance). Thus
  methods for interfaces will take one more argument than do the
  interface declarations.  Note also that recur calls to the method
  head should *not* pass the target object, it will be supplied
  automatically and can not be substituted.

  The return type can be indicated by a type hint on the method name,
  and arg types can be indicated by a type hint on arg names. If you
  leave out all hints, reify will try to match on same name/arity
  method in the protocol(s)/interface(s) - this is preferred. If you
  supply any hints at all, no inference is done, so all hints (or
  default of Object) must be correct, for both arguments and return
  type. If a method is overloaded in a protocol/interface, multiple
  independent method definitions must be supplied.  If overloaded with
  same arity in an interface you must specify complete hints to
  disambiguate - a missing hint implies Object.

  recur works to method heads The method bodies of reify are lexical
  closures, and can refer to the surrounding local scope:
  
  (str (let [f \"foo\"] 
       (reify Object 
         (toString [this] f))))
  == \"foo\"

  (seq (let [f \"foo\"] 
       (reify clojure.lang.Seqable 
         (seq [this] (seq f)))))
  == (\\f \\o \\o))"

  Currently there are no options.

  Each spec consists of a protocol or interface name followed by zero
  or more method bodies:

  protocol-or-interface-or-Object
  (methodName [args*] body)*

  Dynamically generates compiled bytecode for class with the given
  name, in a package with the same name as the current namespace, the
  given fields, and, optionally, methods for protocols and/or
  interfaces.

  The class will have the (immutable) fields named by
  fields, which can have type hints. Protocols/interfaces and methods
  are optional. The only methods that can be supplied are those
  declared in the protocols/interfaces.  Note that method bodies are
  not closures, the local environment includes only the named fields,
  and those fields can be accessed directy.

  Method definitions take the form:

  (methodname [args*] body)

  The argument and return types can be hinted on the arg and
  methodname symbols. If not supplied, they will be inferred, so type
  hints should be reserved for disambiguation.

  Methods should be supplied for all methods of the desired
  protocol(s) and interface(s). You can also define overrides for
  methods of Object. Note that a parameter must be supplied to
  correspond to the target object ('this' in Java parlance). Thus
  methods for interfaces will take one more argument than do the
  interface declarations. Note also that recur calls to the method
  head should *not* pass the target object, it will be supplied
  automatically and can not be substituted.

  In the method bodies, the (unqualified) name can be used to name the
  class (for calls to new, instance? etc).

  The class will have implementations of several (clojure.lang)
  interfaces generated automatically: IObj (metadata support) and
  IPersistentMap, and all of their superinterfaces.

  In addition, defrecord will define type-and-value-based equality and
  hashCode.

  When AOT compiling, generates compiled bytecode for a class with the
  given name (a symbol), prepends the current ns as the package, and
  writes the .class file to the *compile-path* directory.

  Two constructors will be defined, one taking the designated fields
  followed by a metadata map (nil for none) and an extension field
  map (nil for none), and one taking only the fields (using nil for
  meta and extension fields)."

  level constructs, such as Clojure's reference types, in Clojure

  "A protocol is a named set of named methods and their signatures:
  (defprotocol AProtocolName

    \"A doc string for AProtocol abstraction\"

  ;method signatures
    (bar [this a b] \"bar docs\")
    (baz [this a] [this a b] [this a b c] \"baz docs\"))

  No implementations are provided. Docs can be specified for the
  protocol overall and for each method. The above yields a set of
  polymorphic functions and a protocol object. All are
  namespace-qualified by the ns enclosing the definition The resulting
  functions dispatch on the type of their first argument, which is
  required and corresponds to the implicit target object ('this' in 
  Java parlance). defprotocol is dynamic, has no special compile-time 
  effect, and defines no new types or classes. Implementations of 
  the protocol methods can be provided using extend.

  defprotocol will automatically generate a corresponding interface,
  with the same name as the protocol, i.e. given a protocol:
  my.ns/Protocol, an interface: my.ns.Protocol. The interface will
  have methods corresponding to the protocol functions, and the
  protocol will automatically work with instances of the interface.

  Note that you should not use this interface with deftype or
  reify, as they support the protocol directly:

  (defprotocol P 
    (foo [this]) 
    (bar-me [this] [this y]))

  (deftype Foo [a b c] 
   P
    (foo [this] a)
    (bar-me [this] b)
    (bar-me [this y] (+ c y)))
  
  (bar-me (Foo. 1 2 3) 42)
  => 45

  (foo 
    (let [x 42]
      (reify P 
        (foo [this] 17)
        (bar-me [this] x)
        (bar-me [this y] x))))

(defn extend 
  "Implementations of protocol methods can be provided using 
  the extend construct:

  (extend AType
    AProtocol
     {:foo an-existing-fn
      :bar (fn [a b] ...)
      :baz (fn ([a]...) ([a b] ...)...)}
    BProtocol 
      {...} 
    ...)
 
  extend takes a type/class (or interface, see below), and one or more
  protocol + method map pairs. It will extend the polymorphism of the
  protocol's methods to call the supplied methods when an AType is
  provided as the first argument. 

  Method maps are maps of the keyword-ized method names to ordinary
  fns. This facilitates easy reuse of existing fns and fn maps, for
  code reuse/mixins without derivation or composition. You can extend
  an interface to a protocol. This is primarily to facilitate interop
  with the host (e.g. Java) but opens the door to incidental multiple
  inheritance of implementation since a class can inherit from more
  than one interface, both of which extend the protocol. It is TBD how
  to specify which impl to use. You can extend a protocol on nil.

  If you are supplying the definitions explicitly (i.e. not reusing
  exsting functions or mixin maps), you may find it more convenient to
  use the extend-type or extend-protocol macros.

  Note that multiple independent extend clauses can exist for the same
  type, not all protocols need be defined in a single extend call.

(defmacro gen-class 
  "When compiling, generates compiled bytecode for a class with the
  given package-qualified :name (which, as all names in these
  parameters, can be a string or symbol), and writes the .class file
  to the *compile-path* directory.  When not compiling, does
  nothing. The gen-class construct contains no implementation, as the
  implementation will be dynamically sought by the generated class in
  functions in an implementing Clojure namespace. Given a generated
  class org.mydomain.MyClass with a method named mymethod, gen-class
  will generate an implementation that looks for a function named by 
  (str prefix mymethod) (default prefix: \"-\") in a
  Clojure namespace specified by :impl-ns
  (defaults to the current namespace). All inherited methods,
  generated methods, and init and main functions (see :methods, :init,
  and :main below) will be found similarly prefixed. By default, the
  static initializer for the generated class will attempt to load the
  Clojure support code for the class as a resource from the classpath,
  e.g. in the example case, ``org/mydomain/MyClass__init.class``. This
  behavior can be controlled by :load-impl-ns

  Note that methods with a maximum of 18 parameters are supported.

  In all subsequent sections taking types, the primitive types can be
  referred to by their Java names (int, float etc), and classes in the
  java.lang package can be used without a package qualifier. All other
  classes must be fully qualified.

  Options should be a set of key/value pairs, all except for 
  :name are optional:

  :name aname

  The package-qualified name of the class to be generated

  :extends aclass

  Specifies the superclass, the non-private methods of which will be
  overridden by the class. If not provided, defaults to Object.

  :implements [interface ...]

  One or more interfaces, the methods of which will be implemented 
  by the class.

  :init name

  If supplied, names a function that will be called with the arguments
  to the constructor. Must return [ [superclass-constructor-args] state] 
  If not supplied, the constructor args are passed directly to
  the superclass constructor and the state will be nil

  :constructors {[param-types] [super-param-types], ...}

  By default, constructors are created for the generated class which
  match the signature(s) of the constructors for the superclass. This
  parameter may be used to explicitly specify constructors, each entry
  providing a mapping from a constructor signature to a superclass
  constructor signature. When you supply this, you must supply an :init
  specifier. 

  :post-init name

  If supplied, names a function that will be called with the object as
  the first argument, followed by the arguments to the constructor.
  It will be called every time an object of this class is created,
  immediately after all the inherited constructors have completed.
  It's return value is ignored.

  :methods [ [name [param-types] return-type], ...]

  The generated class automatically defines all of the non-private
  methods of its superclasses/interfaces. This parameter can be used
  to specify the signatures of additional methods of the generated
  class. Static methods can be specified with ^{:static true} in the
  signature's metadata. Do not repeat superclass/interface signatures
  here.

  :main boolean

  If supplied and true, a static public main function will be generated. 
  It will pass each string of the String[] argument as a separate 
  argument to a function called (str prefix main).

  :factory name

  If supplied, a (set of) public static factory function(s) will be
  created with the given name, and the same signature(s) as the
  constructor(s).
  
  :state name

  If supplied, a public final instance field with the given name will be
  created. You must supply an :init function in order to provide a
  value for the state. Note that, though final, the state can be a ref
  or agent, supporting the creation of Java objects with transactional
  or asynchronous mutation semantics.

  :exposes {protected-field-name {:get name :set name}, ...}

  Since the implementations of the methods of the generated class
  occur in Clojure functions, they have no access to the inherited
  protected fields of the superclass. This parameter can be used to
  generate public getter/setter methods exposing the protected field(s)
  for use in the implementation.

  :exposes-methods {super-method-name exposed-name, ...}

  It is sometimes necessary to call the superclass' implementation of an
  overridden method.  Those methods may be exposed and referred in 
  the new method implementation by a local name.

  :prefix string

  Default: \"-\" Methods called e.g. Foo will be looked up in vars called
  prefixFoo in the implementing ns.

  :impl-ns name

  Default: the name of the current ns. Implementations of methods will be 
  looked up in this namespace.

  :load-impl-ns boolean

  Default: true. Causes the static initializer for the generated class
  to reference the load code for the implementing namespace. Should be
  true when implementing-ns is the default, false if you intend to
  load the code via some other method."

(alias 'parallel 'clojure.parallel)

(comment "
The parallel library wraps the ForkJoin library scheduled for 
inclusion in JDK 7:

http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/concurrency-interest/index.html

You'll need jsr166y.jar in your classpath in order to use this
library.  The basic idea is that Clojure collections, and most
efficiently vectors, can be turned into parallel arrays for use by
this library with the function par, although most of the functions
take collections and will call par if needed, so normally you will
only need to call par explicitly in order to attach bound/filter/map
ops. Parallel arrays support the attachment of bounds, filters and
mapping functions prior to realization/calculation, which happens as
the result of any of several operations on the
array (pvec/psort/pfilter-nils/pfilter-dupes). Rather than perform
composite operations in steps, as would normally be done with
sequences, maps and filters are instead attached and thus composed by
providing ops to par. Note that there is an order sensitivity to the
attachments - bounds precede filters precede mappings.  All operations
then happen in parallel, using multiple threads and a sophisticated
work-stealing system supported by fork-join, either when the array is
realized, or to perform aggregate operations like preduce/pmin/pmax
etc. A parallel array can be realized into a Clojure vector using
pvec.

(defn cl-format 
  "An implementation of a Common Lisp compatible format function. 
  cl-format formats its arguments to an output stream or string based 
  on the format control string given. It supports sophisticated 
  formatting of structured data.

  Writer is an instance of java.io.Writer, true to output to *out* or 
  nil to output to a string, format-in is the format control string
  and the remaining arguments are the data to be formatted.

  The format control string is a string to be output with embedded
  'format directives' describing how to format the various arguments
  passed in.

  If writer is nil, cl-format returns the formatted result
  string. Otherwise, cl-format returns nil.

For example:
 (let [results [46 38 22]]
   (cl-format true 
     \"There ~[are~;is~:;are~]~:* ~d result~:p: ~{~d~^, ~}~%\" 
     (count results) results))

Prints to *out*:
 There are 3 results: 46, 38, 22

Detailed documentation on format control strings is available in the 
\"Common Lisp the Language, 2nd edition\", Chapter 22 (available 
online at:
http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/ai-repository/

(defn get-pretty-writer 
  "Returns the java.io.Writer passed in wrapped in a pretty writer 
   proxy, unless it's already a pretty writer. Generally, it is 
   unneccesary to call this function, since pprint, write, and 
   cl-format all call it if they need to. However if you want the 
   state to be preserved across calls, you will want to wrap them 
   with this. 

For example, when you want to generate column-aware output with 
multiple calls to cl-format, do it like in this example:

    (defn print-table [aseq column-width]
      (binding [*out* (get-pretty-writer *out*)]
        (doseq [row aseq]
          (doseq [col row]
            (cl-format true \"~4D~7,vT\" col column-width))
          (prn))))

Now when you run:

  user> (print-table (map #(vector % (* % %) (* % % %)) (range 1 11)) 8)

It prints a table of squares and cubes for the numbers from 1 to 10:

       1      1       1    
       2      4       8

;;;      part of the form
;;; `  - Is fully processed at read time into a lisp expression 
;;;      (which will contain concats and regular quotes).
;;; ~@ - Also fully eaten by the processing of ` and can't be used 
;;;      outside.
;;; ,  - is whitespace and is lost (like all other whitespace). 
;;;      Formats can generate commas where they deem them useful 
;;;      to help readability.
;;; ^  - Adding metadata completely disappears at read time and the 
;;;      data appears to be completely lost.

(ns

      :doc "A Pretty Printer for Clojure

clojure.pprint implements a flexible system for printing structured 
data in a pleasing, easy-to-understand format. Basic use of the 
pretty printer is simple, just call pprint instead of println. 
More advanced users can use the building blocks provided to create 
custom output formats. 

Out of the box, pprint supports a simple structured format for basic 
data  and a specialized format for Clojure source code. More advanced 
formats,  including formats that don't look like Clojure data at all 
like XML and JSON, can be rendered by creating custom dispatch 
functions. 

In addition to the pprint function, this module contains cl-format, 
a text formatting function which is fully compatible with the format 
function in Common Lisp. Because pretty printing directives are 
directly integrated with cl-format, it supports very concise custom 
dispatch. It also provides a more powerful alternative to Clojure's 
standard format function.

See documentation for pprint and cl-format for more information or 
complete documentation on the the clojure web site on github.",

Alpha - subject to change.

Two main entry points: 

* type-reflect reflects on something that implements TypeReference.
* reflect (for REPL use) reflects on the class of an instance, or
  on a class if passed a class

Key features:

* Exposes the read side of reflection as pure data. Reflecting
  on a type returns a map with keys :bases, :flags, and :members.

* Canonicalizes class names as Clojure symbols. Types can extend
  to the TypeReference protocol to indicate that they can be
  unambiguously resolved as a type name. The canonical format
  requires one non-Java-ish convention: array brackets are <>
  instead of [] so they can be part of a Clojure symbol.

* Pluggable Reflectors for different implementations. The default
  JavaReflector is good when you have a class in hand, or use
  the AsmReflector for \"hands off\" reflection without forcing
  classes to load.

Platform implementers must:

* Create an implementation of Reflector.
* Create one or more implementations of TypeReference.
* def default-reflector to be an instance that satisfies Reflector."}

   Reflect on a typeref, returning a map with :bases, :flags, and

   :bases            a set of names of the type's bases
   :flags            a set of keywords naming the boolean attributes
                     of the type.
   :members          a set of the type's members. Each membrer is a map
                     and can be a constructor, method, or field.

   Keys common to all members:
   :name             name of the type 
   :declaring-class  name of the declarer
   :flags            keyword naming boolean attributes of the member

   Key specific to methods:
   :parameter-types  vector of parameter type names
   :exception-types  vector of exception type names

(ns ^{:doc "Clojure String utilities

It is poor form to (:use clojure.string). Instead, use require
with :as to specify a prefix, e.g.

(ns your.namespace.here
  (:require [clojure.string :as str]))

Design notes for clojure.string:

1. Strings are objects (as opposed to sequences). As such, the
   string being manipulated is the first argument to a function;
   passing nil will result in a NullPointerException unless
   documented otherwise. If you want sequence-y behavior instead,
   use a sequence.

2. Functions are generally not lazy, and call straight to host
   methods where those are available and efficient.

3. Functions take advantage of String implementation details to
   write high-performing loop/recurs instead of using higher-order
   functions. (This is not idiomatic in general-purpose application
   code.)

4. When a function is documented to accept a string argument, it
   will take any implementation of the correct *interface* on the
   host platform. In Java, this is CharSequence, which is more
   general than String. In ordinary usage you will almost always
   pass concrete strings. If you are doing something unusual,
   e.g. passing a mutable implementation of CharSequence, then
   thead-safety is your responsibility."

  JUnit (http://junit.org/) is the most popular unit-testing library

;;; test.clj: test framework for Clojure

;; by Stuart Sierra
;; March 28, 2009

;; Thanks to Chas Emerick, Allen Rohner, and Stuart Halloway for
;; contributions and suggestions.

(ns 
  ^{:author "Stuart Sierra, with contributions and suggestions by 
  Chas Emerick, Allen Rohner, and Stuart Halloway",
     :doc "A unit testing framework.

   ASSERTIONS

   The core of the library is the \"is\" macro, which lets you make
   assertions of any arbitrary expression:

   (is (= 4 (+ 2 2)))
   (is (instance? Integer 256))
   (is (.startsWith \"abcde\" \"ab\"))

   You can type an \"is\" expression directly at the REPL, which will
   print a message if it fails.

       user> (is (= 5 (+ 2 2)))

       FAIL in  (:1)
       expected: (= 5 (+ 2 2))
         actual: (not (= 5 4))
       false

   The \"expected:\" line shows you the original expression, and the
   \"actual:\" shows you what actually happened.  In this case, it
   shows that (+ 2 2) returned 4, which is not = to 5.  Finally, the
   \"false\" on the last line is the value returned from the
   expression.  The \"is\" macro always returns the result of the
   inner expression.

   There are two special assertions for testing exceptions.  The
   \"(is (thrown? c ...))\" form tests if an exception of class c is
   thrown:

   (is (thrown? ArithmeticException (/ 1 0))) 

   \"(is (thrown-with-msg? c re ...))\" does the same thing and also
   tests that the message on the exception matches the regular
   expression re:

   (is (thrown-with-msg? ArithmeticException #\"Divide by zero\"
                         (/ 1 0)))

   DOCUMENTING TESTS

   \"is\" takes an optional second argument, a string describing the
   assertion.  This message will be included in the error report.

   (is (= 5 (+ 2 2)) \"Crazy arithmetic\")

   In addition, you can document groups of assertions with the
   \"testing\" macro, which takes a string followed by any number of
   assertions.  The string will be included in failure reports.
   Calls to \"testing\" may be nested, and all of the strings will be
   joined together with spaces in the final report, in a style
   similar to RSpec <http://rspec.info/>

   (testing \"Arithmetic\"
     (testing \"with positive integers\"
       (is (= 4 (+ 2 2)))
       (is (= 7 (+ 3 4))))
     (testing \"with negative integers\"
       (is (= -4 (+ -2 -2)))
       (is (= -1 (+ 3 -4)))))

   Note that, unlike RSpec, the \"testing\" macro may only be used
   INSIDE a \"deftest\" or \"with-test\" form (see below).


   DEFINING TESTS

   There are two ways to define tests.  The \"with-test\" macro takes
   a defn or def form as its first argument, followed by any number
   of assertions.  The tests will be stored as metadata on the
   definition.

   (with-test
       (defn my-function [x y]
         (+ x y))
     (is (= 4 (my-function 2 2)))
     (is (= 7 (my-function 3 4))))

   As of Clojure SVN rev. 1221, this does not work with defmacro.
   See http://code.google.com/p/clojure/issues/detail?id=51

   The other way lets you define tests separately from the rest of
   your code, even in a different namespace:

   (deftest addition
     (is (= 4 (+ 2 2)))
     (is (= 7 (+ 3 4))))

   (deftest subtraction
     (is (= 1 (- 4 3)))
     (is (= 3 (- 7 4))))

   This creates functions named \"addition\" and \"subtraction\", which
   can be called like any other function.  Therefore, tests can be
   grouped and composed, in a style similar to the test framework in
   Peter Seibel's \"Practical Common Lisp\"
   <http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/
        practical-building-a-unit-test-framework.html>

   (deftest arithmetic
     (addition)
     (subtraction))

   The names of the nested tests will be joined in a list, like
   \"(arithmetic addition)\", in failure reports.  You can use nested
   tests to set up a context shared by several tests.


   RUNNING TESTS

   Run tests with the function \"(run-tests namespaces...)\":

   (run-tests 'your.namespace 'some.other.namespace)

   If you don't specify any namespaces, the current namespace is
   used.  To run all tests in all namespaces, use \"(run-all-tests)\".

   By default, these functions will search for all tests defined in
   a namespace and run them in an undefined order.  However, if you
   are composing tests, as in the \"arithmetic\" example above, you
   probably do not want the \"addition\" and \"subtraction\" tests run
   separately.  In that case, you must define a special function
   named \"test-ns-hook\" that runs your tests in the correct order:

   (defn test-ns-hook []
     (arithmetic))

   Note: test-ns-hook prevents execution of fixtures (see below).


   OMITTING TESTS FROM PRODUCTION CODE

   You can bind the variable \"*load-tests*\" to false when loading or
   compiling code in production.  This will prevent any tests from
   being created by \"with-test\" or \"deftest\".


   FIXTURES

   Fixtures allow you to run code before and after tests, to set up
   the context in which tests should be run.

   A fixture is just a function that calls another function passed as
   an argument.  It looks like this:

   (defn my-fixture [f]
      Perform setup, establish bindings, whatever.
     (f)  Then call the function we were passed.
      Tear-down / clean-up code here.
    )

   Fixtures are attached to namespaces in one of two ways.  \"each\"
   fixtures are run repeatedly, once for each test function created
   with \"deftest\" or \"with-test\".  \"each\" fixtures are useful for
   establishing a consistent before/after state for each test, like
   clearing out database tables.

   \"each\" fixtures can be attached to the current namespace like this:
   (use-fixtures :each fixture1 fixture2 ...)
   The fixture1, fixture2 are just functions like the example above.
   They can also be anonymous functions, like this:
   (use-fixtures :each (fn [f] setup... (f) cleanup...))

   The other kind of fixture, a \"once\" fixture, is only run once,
   around ALL the tests in the namespace.  \"once\" fixtures are useful
   for tasks that only need to be performed once, like establishing
   database connections, or for time-consuming tasks.

   Attach \"once\" fixtures to the current namespace like this:
   (use-fixtures :once fixture1 fixture2 ...)

   Note: Fixtures and test-ns-hook are mutually incompatible.  If you
   are using test-ns-hook, fixture functions will *never* be run.


   SAVING TEST OUTPUT TO A FILE

   All the test reporting functions write to the var *test-out*.  By
   default, this is the same as *out*, but you can rebind it to any
   PrintWriter.  For example, it could be a file opened with
   clojure.java.io/writer.


   EXTENDING TEST-IS (ADVANCED)

   You can extend the behavior of the \"is\" macro by defining new
   methods for the \"assert-expr\" multimethod.  These methods are
   called during expansion of the \"is\" macro, so they should return
   quoted forms to be evaluated.

   You can plug in your own test-reporting framework by rebinding
   the \"report\" function: (report event)

   The 'event' argument is a map.  It will always have a :type key,
   whose value will be a keyword signaling the type of event being
   reported.  Standard events with :type value of :pass, :fail, and
   :error are called when an assertion passes, fails, and throws an
   exception, respectively.  In that case, the event will also have
   the following keys:

     :expected   The form that was expected to be true
     :actual     A form representing what actually occurred
     :message    The string message given as an argument to 'is'

   The \"testing\" strings will be a list in \"*testing-contexts*\", and
   the vars being tested will be a list in \"*testing-vars*\".

   Your \"report\" function should wrap any printing calls in the
   \"with-test-out\" macro, which rebinds *out* to the current value
   of *test-out*.

   For additional event types, see the examples in the code.

\chapter{Copyright and Licenses}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{chunk}{Clojure License}
Eclipse Public License - v 1.0

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF
THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
documentation distributed under this Agreement, and

b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

i) changes to the Program, and

ii) additions to the Program;

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and
are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such
Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's
behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which:
(i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with
the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor
which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution
alone or when combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this
Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this
Agreement, including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and
object code form.

b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if
any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall
apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
licensed hereunder.

c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each
Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by
any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights
or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses
granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility
to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For
example, if a third party patent license is required to allow
Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility
to acquire that license before distributing the Program.

d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright
license set forth in this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form
under its own license agreement, provided that:

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

b) its license agreement:

i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties
and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or
conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability
for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
consequential damages, such as lost profits;

iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are
offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the
Program.

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
within the Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the
like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use
of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a
commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not
create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,
such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend
and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor")
against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising
from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party
against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts
or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its
distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The
obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property
infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a)
promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim,
and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with
the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such
claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
defend claims against the other Contributors related to those
performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor
must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to
the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable
laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR
ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR
DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other
software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such
Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of
the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably
practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and
any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall
continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign
the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable
separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a
distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions)
may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement
under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the
Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the
Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as
expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives
no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor
under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or
otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this
Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and
the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No
party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement
more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives
its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

\chapter{Building Clojure from this document}

\section{The basic idea}
Literate programs are \TeX documents that contain executable source code.
If you have a running system you can use the included clojure code to
extract chunks at will. But what if you don't have clojure yet? There
has to be a ``bootstrap'' mechanism and we supply that here.

First, you need to edit this file and clip out the ``tangle'' function
written in C below. You compile this with GCC. This gives you a small
program that will extract named chunks from this document.

Second, you extract the Makefile chunk. This Makefile will use the tangle
function to create the clojure source tree, including the build.xml file
which is used by the ant build program. Note that this should be
rewritten to be part of the build.xml but that is not part of Clojure.

Third, you run the Makefile. It will extract all of the code into the
proper places in the source tree and run the ant build process to 
create a running Clojure.

\defsection{The tangle function in Clojure}
This is the tangle function written in Clojure.
It would be useful to modify the reader to directly extract source
code from literate documents. That would make literate documents a
native file format for Clojure. 

\defsubsection{Author and License}
\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

\defsubsection{Abstract and Use Cases}

Don Knuth has defined literate programming as a combination of 
documentation and source code in a single file. The TeX language
is documented this way in books. Knuth defined two functions
\begin{packeditemize}
\item tangle -> extract the source code from a literate file
\item weave  -> extract the latex from a literate file
\end{packeditemize}

This seems unnecessarily complex. Latex is a full programming
language and is capable of defining ``environments'' that can 
handle code directly in Latex. Here we define the correct 
environment macros. Thus, the ``weave'' function is not needed.

If this ``tangle'' function were added to Clojure then Clojure could
read literate files in Latex format and extract the code. We create
the necessary "tangle" function here.

This program will extract the source code from a literate file.

A literate lisp file contains a mixture of latex and lisp sources code.
The file is intended to be in standard latex format. In order to 
delimit code chunks we define a latex ``chunk'' environment. 

Latex format files defines a newenvironment so that code chunks
can be delimited by \verb|\begin{chunk}{name}| $\ldots$ 
\verb|\end{chunk}| blocks. This is supported by the following latex code.

So a trivial example of a literate latex file might look like

\begin{verbatim}
 this is a file that is in a literate
 form it has a chunk called
 \begin{chunk}{first chunk}
 THIS IS THE FIRST CHUNK
 \end{chunk}
 and this is a second chunk
 \begin{chunk}{second chunk}
 THIS IS THE SECOND CHUNK
 \end{chunk}
 and this is more in the first chunk
 \begin{chunk}{first chunk}
 \getchunk{second chunk}
 THIS IS MORE IN THE FIRST CHUNK
 \end{chunk}
 \begin{chunk}{all}
 \getchunk{first chunk}
 \getchunk{second chunk}
 \end{chunk}
 and that's it
\end{verbatim}

From a file called ``testcase'' that contains the above text
we want to extract the chunk names ``second chunk''. We do this with:

\begin{verbatim}
 (tangle "testcase" "second chunk")
\end{verbatim}

which yields:

\begin{verbatim}
 THIS IS THE SECOND CHUNK
\end{verbatim}

From the same file we might extract the chunk named ``first chunk''.
Notice that this has the second chunk embedded recursively inside.
So we execute:

\begin{verbatim}
 (tangle "testcase" "first chunk")
\end{verbatim}

which yields:

\begin{verbatim}
 THIS IS THE FIRST CHUNK
 THIS IS THE SECOND CHUNK
 THIS IS MORE IN THE FIRST CHUNK
\end{verbatim}

There is a third chunk called ``all'' which will extract both chunks:

\begin{verbatim}
 (tangle "testcase" "all")
\end{verbatim}

which yields

\begin{verbatim}
 THIS IS THE FIRST CHUNK
 THIS IS THE SECOND CHUNK
 THIS IS MORE IN THE FIRST CHUNK
 THIS IS THE SECOND CHUNK
\end{verbatim}

The tangle function takes a third argument which is the name of
an output file. Thus, you can write the same results to a file with:

\begin{verbatim}
 (tangle "testcase" "all" "outputfile")
\end{verbatim}

It is also worth noting that all chunks with the same name will be
merged into one chunk so it is possible to split chunks in mulitple
parts and have them extracted as one. That is,

\begin{verbatim}
 \begin{chunk}{a partial chunk}
 part 1 of the partial chunk
 \end{chunk}
 not part of the chunk
 \begin{chunk}{a partial chunk}
 part 2 of the partial chunk
 \end{chunk}
\end{verbatim}

These will be combined on output as a single chunk. Thus

\begin{verbatim}
 (tangle "testmerge" "a partial chunk")
\end{verbatim}

will yield

\begin{verbatim}
 part 1 of the partial chunk
 part 2 of the partial chunk
\end{verbatim}

\defsubsection{The Latex Support Code}

The verbatim package quotes everything within its grasp and is used to
hide and quote the source code during latex formatting. The verbatim
environment is built in but the package form lets us use it in our
chunk environment and it lets us change the font.

\begin{verbatim}
 \usepackage{verbatim}
\end{verbatim}
 
Make the verbatim font smaller
Note that we have to temporarily change the \verb|'@'| to be just a character
because the \verb|@font| name uses it as a character

\begin{verbatim}
 \chardef\atcode=\catcode`\@
 \catcode`\@=11
 \renewcommand{\verbatim@font}{\ttfamily\small}
 \catcode`\@=\atcode
\end{verbatim}

This declares a new environment named ``chunk'' which has one
argument that is the name of the chunk. All code needs to live
between the \verb|\begin{chunk}{name}| and the \verb|\end{chunk}|
The ``name'' is used to define the chunk.
Reuse of the same chunk name later concatenates the chunks

For those of you who can't read latex this says:
Make a new environment named chunk with one argument
The first block is the code for the \verb|\begin{chunk}{name}|
The second block is the code for the \verb|\end{chunk}|
The \verb|%| is the latex comment character

We have two alternate markers, a lightweight one using dashes
and a heavyweight one using the \verb|\begin| and \verb|\end| syntax
You can choose either one by changing the comment char in column 1

\begin{verbatim}
 \newenvironment{chunk}[1]{%   we need the chunkname as an argument
 {\ }\newline\noindent%                    make sure we are in column 1
 %{\small $\backslash{}$begin\{chunk\}\{{\bf #1}\}}% alternate begin mark
 \hbox{\hskip 2.0cm}{\bf --- #1 ---}%      mark the beginning
 \verbatim}%                               say exactly what we see
 {\endverbatim%                            process \end{chunk}
 \par{}%                                   we add a newline
 \noindent{}%                              start in column 1
 \hbox{\hskip 2.0cm}{\bf ----------}%      mark the end
 %$\backslash{}$end\{chunk\}%              alternate end mark (commented)
 \par%                                     and a newline
 \normalsize\noindent}%                    and return to the document
\end{verbatim}

This declares the place where we want to expand a chunk
Technically we don't need this because a getchunk must always
be properly nested within a chunk and will be verbatim.

\begin{verbatim}
 \providecommand{\getchunk}[1]{%
 \noindent%
 {\small $\backslash{}$begin\{chunk\}\{{\bf #1}\}}}% mark the reference

\end{verbatim}

\defsubsection{Imports}

\begin{chunk}{Clojure tangle}
(import [java.io BufferedReader FileReader BufferedWriter FileWriter])
(import [java.lang String])

\end{chunk}

\defsubsection{The Tangle Command}

The tangle command does all of the work of extracting code.

In latex form the code blocks are delimited by
\begin{verbatim}
     \begin{chunk}{name}
     ... (code for name)...
     \end{chunk}
\end{verbatim}

and referenced by \verb|\getchunk{name}| which gets replaced by the code

There are several ways to invoke the tangle function. 

The first argument is always the file from which to extract code

The second argument is the name of the chunk to extract
\begin{verbatim}
        (tangle "clweb.pamphlet" "name")   
\end{verbatim}

The standard chunk name is ``*'' but any name can be used.

The third arument is the name of an output file:
\begin{verbatim}
  (tangle "clweb.pamphlet" "clweb.chunk" "clweb.spadfile")
\end{verbatim}

\defsubsection{The say function}

This function will either write to the output file, or if null,
to the console

\begin{chunk}{Clojure tangle}
(defn say [where what]
 (if where
  (do (.write where what) (.write where "\n"))
  (println what)))

\end{chunk}

\defsubsection{The read-file function}

Here we return a lazy sequence that will fetch lines as we need them 
from the file.

\begin{chunk}{Clojure tangle}
(defn read-file [streamname]
 ^{:doc "Implement read-sequence in GCL"}
 (let [stream (BufferedReader. (FileReader. streamname))]
  (line-seq stream)))

\end{chunk}

\defsubsection{The ischunk function}

There is a built-in assumption (in the ischunk functions)
that the chunks occur on separate lines and that the indentation
of the chunk reference has no meaning.

The ischunk function recognizes chunk names in latex convention

There are 3 cases to recognize:
\begin{verbatim}
  \begin{chunk}{thechunkname}  ==> 'define thechunkname
  \end{chunk}                  ==> 'end nil
  \getchunk{thechunkname}      ==> 'refer thechunkname
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
The regex pattern #"^\\begin\{chunk\}\{.*\}$" matches
 \begin{chunk}{anything here}
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
The regex pattern #"^\\end\{chunk\}$" matches
 \end{chunk}
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
The regex pattern #"^\\getchunk\{.*\}$" matches
 \getchunk{anything here}
\end{verbatim}

\begin{chunk}{Clojure tangle}
(defn ischunk [line]
 ^{:doc "Find chunks delimited by latex syntax"}
 (let [ begin   #"^\\begin\{chunk\}\{.*\}$"
        end     #"^\\end\{chunk\}$"
        get     #"^\\getchunk\{.*\}$"
        trimmed (.trim line) ]
  (cond
   (re-find begin trimmed)
     (list 'define (apply str (butlast (drop 14 trimmed))))
   (re-find end trimmed)
     (list 'end nil)
   (re-find get trimmed)
     (list 'refer trimmed)
   :else
     (list nil trimmed))))
  
\end{chunk}

\defsubsection{The haschunks function}

The hashchunks function gathers the chunks and puts them in the hash table

If we find the chunk syntax and it is a
\begin{packeditemize}
\item define ==> parse the chunkname and start gathering lines onto a stack
\item end ==> push the completed list of lines into a stack of chunks
already in the hash table
\item otherwise ==> if we are gathering, push the line onto the stack
\end{packeditemize}

A hash table entry is a list of lists such as
\begin{verbatim}
 (("6" "5") ("4" "3") ("2" "1"))
\end{verbatim}
each of the sublists is a set of lines in reverse (stack) order
each sublist is a single chunk of lines. 
There is a new sublist for each reuse of the same chunkname

Calls to ischunk can have 4 results (define, end, refer, nil) where
\begin{packeditemize}
\item define ==$>$ we found a \verb|\begin{chunk}{...}|
\item end ==$>$ we found a \verb|\end{chunk}|
\item refer ==$>$ we found a \verb|\getchunk{...}|
\item nil ==$>$ ordinary text or program text
\end{packeditemize}
              
The variable gather is initially false, 
implying that we are not gathering code.
The variable gather is true if we are gathering a chunk.

\begin{chunk}{Clojure tangle}
(defn hashchunks [lines]
 ^{:doc "Gather all of the chunks and put them into a hash table"}
 (loop [ line      lines
         gather    false 
         hash      (hash-map) 
         chunkname "" ]
  (if (not (empty? line))
   (let [[key value] (ischunk (first line))]
    (condp = key
     'define
       (recur (rest line) true hash value)
     'end
       (recur (rest line) false hash chunkname)
     'refer
       (if gather
         (recur (rest line) gather
           (assoc hash chunkname 
            (conj (get hash chunkname) value)) chunkname)
         (recur (rest line) gather hash chunkname))
     nil
       (if gather
         (recur (rest line) gather  
           (assoc hash chunkname 
            (conj (get hash chunkname) value)) chunkname)
         (recur (rest line) gather hash chunkname))))
   hash)))

\end{chunk}

\defsubsection{The expand function}

The expand function will recursively expand chunks in the hash table.
 
Latex chunk names are just the chunkname itself e.g. chunkname

A hash table key is the chunk name and the value is a reverse
list of all of the text in that chunk.
To process the chunk we reverse the main list and
for each sublist we reverse the sublist and process the lines

If a chunk name reference is encountered in a line we call expand
recursively to expand the inner chunkname.

\begin{chunk}{Clojure tangle}
(defn expand [chunkname where table]
 ^{:doc recursively expand latex getchunk tags}
 (let [chunk (reverse (get table chunkname))]
  (when chunk
   (loop [lines chunk]
    (when (not (empty? lines))
     (let [line (first lines)]
      (let [[key value] (ischunk line)]
       (if (= key 'refer)
        (do 
         (expand (apply str (butlast (drop 10 value))) where table)
         (recur (rest lines)))
        (do (say where line)
         (recur (rest lines)))))))))))

\end{chunk}

\defsubsection{The tangle function}

We expand all of the lines in the file that are surrounded by the
requested chunk name. These chunk names are looked up in the hash
table built by hashchunks, given the input filename.
then we recursively expand the ``topchunk'' to the output stream

\begin{chunk}{Clojure tangle}
(defn tangle
 ^{:doc "Extract the source code from a pamphlet file, 
         optional file output"}
 ([filename topchunk] (tangle filename topchunk nil))
 ([filename topchunk file]
  (if (string? file)
   (with-open [where (BufferedWriter. (FileWriter. file))]
    (expand topchunk where (hashchunks (read-file filename))))
   (expand topchunk nil (hashchunks (read-file filename))))))

\end{chunk}
